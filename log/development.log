大学里有很多专业（或者学科），每个专业都会有很多课程，这些课程之所以会被聚到一起，必然是因为它们之间彼此相关。但是很多人一路学下来，往往是考完试就把学到的80%以上的知识又还给老师了。因为学习的过程是一门一门的学，等全学完了，之前的N-1门课程还能记住的东西已经不多了，谁又会通盘把他们罗列出来再去考虑他们之前是否有联系呢？毕竟你的每一门课程考试都过了，你也拿到了毕业证，所以这些就不再重要了。但是如果你还有机会，我的意思是说你仍然在学习的过程中，并且希望真正能把一门专业搞透（注意而非仅仅是把一门课程搞透），那么你需要做的正是打通所有课程之间的脉络，让自己是思路清晰的去学习，这就相当于你手里握着地图，当然就不会迷失。

我之前曾经发过一篇博文《大学计算机专业那些课》来谈论大学中各门课程的意义和重要性。那是针对更宽泛的范围来说的，这篇文章则更加精要和简约。因为这里研究的仅仅是核心计算机课程（数学和外语当然不在此范畴），更重要的是，这里要说的是这些课程之间的关系，以及它到底讲得是些什么东西。我想这些课程最终是要组成一个体系的。

请注意我这里所说的是通常情况下的核心课程，每个学校在课程设置是可能是存在差异的，但总体上框架应该是不变的。而且这里特指的是大学本科阶段需要掌握的课程，因为到了研究生甚至博士阶段，方向已经更明确，而且更窄小，他们更应该追求的是深度和新知，这些东西就只有Paper上才有了。

最开始的第一门课应该是“C语言程序设计”，这基本上属于你日后一切学习的开始（也有的人认为第一门课不应该是计算机文化基础吗？好吧，我想说那个真的不能算核心。这么说的人，你得把自己定位定的稍微高点，你的将来不是要去电脑城里卖电脑，也不是要整天帮别人换个内存条什么的），简单说这门课程的主要目的和内容就是介绍一种计算机语言的语法内容，至于怎么学好它，之前的文章都谈过了，这里就不罗嗦了。

之后的课程会分为三条线，第一条线的第一门课程是“数据结构与算法”。这很简单，一些有了语言基础之后，为了更好的使用语言去解决问题，就必须学习结构知识和算法。这门课程非常重要（至于这一点我准备另写一篇文章来专门谈）。至于怎么学好它，之前的文章也谈过了——请注意，如何学都不是本文的重点。本文的重点在于告诉你你将来都会学些什么以及该学些什么。

其实在数据结构与算法课程之前，你还需要学一门课：离散数学。数据结构与算法 最开始的名字应该是 离散数据结构与算法，后来把离散给简化掉了。事实上，你不学离散数学而直接学数据结构与算法根本没有问题。因为这门课难度不大。另外这门课也不能完全算核心，但是比较基础。这门课里讲到的图论，在数据结构会被具象化，这门课里讲的逻辑运算其实在C里面你应该已经用过了，而这些逻辑计算在学“数电”的时候，你会相当重学一遍，而且让你印象更深，因为数电会帮你把抽象的东西具体化，把逻辑的东西物理化。这一点我们会在线路二里再来讨论。

“数据结构与算法”的后续课程是什么？答案应该是《编译原理》。很奇怪吧？课程就是这样设计的，其实这个路线也不是我发明的，国外大学的CS Course的体系也是这么设计的。编译原理说白了就是介绍编译器如何工作的，是让计算机理解计算机语言的一种方法和理论。中国的教育显然不需要你在学完这门课后能写个编译器出来（但是我的一个合作者确实自己干过这件事）。真要是能写出编译器，还是需要对底层有更深的认识和了解的，所以就需要操作系统，组成原理以及汇编方面知识的支撑了，但因为这在本科阶段是不做要求的（其实很多大学教授自己都做不出来，又怎么要求你呢？），所以学这门课的时候可以把重心放到理解那些超复杂的算法上。因为让计算机理解一门语言，本身这个工作过程之中就蕴含了大量的算法，而且是非常复杂的算法，很多人甚至认为编译原理是计算机专业本科阶段最难的一门课程。主要就是因为这里面的算法太复杂，当然也会用到很多结构，树可能是用得最多的。当然，这就是相当于是数据结构与算法课程的一个后续性课程，类似一道附加题。最近听一个学生说有些学校本科已经取消这门课了，我想应该是较少一部分学校的做法吧。不过，中国的学习并不太重视这门课倒是真的。一般课程设置就是一个学期左右的课时。但是一般的国外学校这门课都要学上1年，甚至两年之久。这条线路到编译这里就应该是终点了。下面我们再来介绍剩下的两条线路。

其实在数据结构与算法课程之前，你还需要学一门课：离散数学。数据结构与算法 最开始的名字应该是 离散数据结构与算法，后来把离散给简化掉了。事实上，你不学离散数学而直接学数据结构与算法根本没有问题。因为这门课难度不大。另外这门课也不能完全算核心，但是比较基础。这门课里讲到的图论，在数据结构会被具象化，这门课里讲的逻辑运算其实在C里面你应该已经用过了，而这些逻辑计算在学“数电”的时候，你会相当重学一遍，而且让你印象更深，因为数电会帮你把抽象的东西具体化，把逻辑的东西物理化。这一点我们会在线路二里再来讨论。

“数据结构与算法”的后续课程是什么？答案应该是《编译原理》。很奇怪吧？课程就是这样设计的，其实这个路线也不是我发明的，国外大学的CS Course的体系也是这么设计的。编译原理说白了就是介绍编译器如何工作的，是让计算机理解计算机语言的一种方法和理论。中国的教育显然不需要你在学完这门课后能写个编译器出来（但是我的一个合作者确实自己干过这件事）。真要是能写出编译器，还是需要对底层有更深的认识和了解的，所以就需要操作系统，组成原理以及汇编方面知识的支撑了，但因为这在本科阶段是不做要求的（其实很多大学教授自己都做不出来，又怎么要求你呢？），所以学这门课的时候可以把重心放到理解那些超复杂的算法上。因为让计算机理解一门语言，本身这个工作过程之中就蕴含了大量的算法，而且是非常复杂的算法，很多人甚至认为编译原理是计算机专业本科阶段最难的一门课程。主要就是因为这里面的算法太复杂，当然也会用到很多结构，树可能是用得最多的。当然，这就是相当于是数据结构与算法课程的一个后续性课程，类似一道附加题。最近听一个学生说有些学校本科已经取消这门课了，我想应该是较少一部分学校的做法吧。不过，中国的学习并不太重视这门课倒是真的。一般课程设置就是一个学期左右的课时。但是一般的国外学校这门课都要学上1年，甚至两年之久。这条线路到编译这里就应该是终点了。下面我们再来介绍剩下的两条线路。

未完，待续...

PS：后续主页菌将逐步梳理完善大学CS课程的体系并完善书单。只有更专业，才会更出色！希望大家同学给力关注~', "updated_at" = '2013-06-28 15:18:28.407356' WHERE "reviews"."id" = 6[0m

\r\n\r\n在历史上，我们一直觉着智能不只是人类所独有的，可以像人类一样进行推理和学习的机器是完全可能被制造出来的，然而事情却不像想的那样简单。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n什么是人工智能？\r\n\r\n在百科全书上，人工智能的定义是“有关可以智能地工作的机器的科学和工程”。不过一个令人纠结的问题是：到底什么是智能？即便那些“不智能”的机器在很多时候已经比我们聪明了，比如普通的计算机程序可以将成千上万个数字相乘，可以记录下银行大量余额款项，这已经超出了普通人的能力，可是他们只是能够大量重复做同一件事情，而且给出了正确的结果而已，还称不上真正的“智能”。只有某些人类特有的能力，像认出一张熟悉的脸，指挥繁忙时段的交通或者学会一件乐器，才有资格称得上“智能”。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n为什么让一台机器做这些事情这么难？这是因为，一般程序员在给电脑编写程序之前知道他想让电脑做的任务是什么，可是在人工智能领域我们要求电脑做正确的事情，可同时又不是很清楚事情到底是什么。比如我们让电脑去识别人脸，可是我们人类自己也不是完全清楚大脑在识别人脸的时候到底是怎么样工作的。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n在现实世界中，我们要面对种种不确定性，比如你在做一件事情的时候，一个竞争对手突然出现，阻止你达到目标；你在驾车的时候，有时会转动方向盘改变车的方向，避免撞上其他的车，但是这样做是不是一定安全，只有天知道；或者在正在完成一项任务的过程中，突然来了一条新消息，需要随机应变。一个人工智能的电脑程序不能仅仅按照既定的计划完成任务，需要处理类似上面这样的所有不确定性的情形。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n为了模拟人类的智能，电脑程序不仅要模拟完成的任务本身，还要为这个任务所处的世界建立模型。他必须感知到周围环境的变化，并且做出反应，相应的改变和调整自己的行动。只有一台机器可以在不确定的条件下做出正确的决定，才称得上智能。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n哲学起源\r\n\r\n人工智能的概念在世界上第一台电脑出现之前的很多个世纪就已经初具端倪，亚里士多德提出的从假设得出结论的“三段论”就是一种机械式的逻辑推理方法，。按照他的理论，我们可以这样进行论述：\r\n\r\n前提：一些天鹅是白的；所有天鹅都是鸟\r\n\r\n结论：有一些鸟是白的。\r\n\r\n如果用符号来表示：\r\n\r\n前提：一些S是W，所有的S都是B\r\n\r\n结论：有一些B是W。\r\n\r\n无论S，W，B代表什么，也就是说无论这句话中的词语具体是什么，我们都可以得到正确的结论。根据这样的构想，我们在没有完全知道人是怎么想问题的情况下，或许就可以建立出一套智能化的工作机制。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n亚里斯多德的构想为探寻人工智能的本质奠定了基础。然而直到二十世纪中期，电脑才变得足够复杂，能够去真正测试一下这些构想。1948年英国布里斯托尔大学的研究人员Grey Walter制造了一些可以移动，可以感光，可以学习的机器乌龟。其中有一个叫Elsie的机器乌龟可以自动地对环境做出反应，比如当电池电量快耗尽的时候它就会自动地降低对光线的敏感度。这些复杂的行为使得这只机械乌龟看起来不仅仅是个机器人，而是像自然界的动物一样，会做出我们预料不到的举动。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n在1950年，天才图灵提出，如果电脑和一个人可以谈话自如，我们应该“礼貌地”接受电脑可以思考的现实。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n不过直到1956年，人工智能这个词语才正式被提出。在美国达特茅斯学院的一个暑期工作坊上，这个领域的早期创始者们共同提出了他们的愿景：如果学习的各种方式和智能各个侧面都可以从理论上进行精确描述，这样一台机器就可以模拟人的一切。按照这样的目标快速发展，似乎拥有真人一般智能的机器早晚会出现。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**化整为零**\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n在二十世纪六十年代的时候，人工智能研究人员满怀梦想，信心十足，觉着他们将会在几十年的时间内实现他们的目标，就像在航天领域从第一架喷气式飞机到人类登上月球也只用了30年。为什么人工智能不可以拥有这样火箭般的发展速度呢？\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n不过两者之间最大的不同之处在于，对于人工智能，我们找不到像F=ma和E=mc^2那样既简洁又决定一切的公式。到了八十年代，研究者意识到他们既没有足够硬件也没有足够的知识来模拟人可以做的所有事情，于是整个领域分成了很多个部分。以往研究者的共同的目标是制造一台拥有人类智慧的电脑，取而代之的是，研究者侧重于去研究这个宏大问题的某个侧面，比如语音识别，计算机视觉，概率推理-甚至仅仅是国际象棋这个小领域。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n在每个领域内，研究者都取得了可喜的进步。在1997年，IBM“更深的蓝”电脑击败了国际象棋冠军卡斯帕罗夫。“更深的蓝”电脑在决定下一步怎么走棋的时候，在一秒的时间内就可以计算出两亿种不同的可能性。这使得电脑棋手可以在下一步棋之前事先推算出之后很多很多步棋可能出现的各种情况，来决定哪种局面是对自己最有利的。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“更深的蓝”电脑可以在一项需要高度智能的游戏中取得引人瞩目的胜利，然而，这位“专家”的技能有点太单一了，除了赢得一场象棋比赛以外，它什么都不会做，既不能和别人讨论他在下棋的时候使用过的策略，也不能玩其他的游戏，它尽管赢了世界大师，但是没有人会把它错当作真人，它还仅仅是一台电脑。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n人工智能的时间线：\r\n\r\n1950年 图灵提出，经过编程的电子计算机可以像真人一样回答问题\r\n\r\n1956年 在美国达特茅斯学院的一个暑期工作坊上，这个领域的早期创始者们正式提出了“人工智能”这个词汇\r\n\r\n1958年 Allen Newell和Herbert Simon预测在十年内，电脑可以击败国际象棋世界冠军，不过在现实中这整整花了四十年。\r\n\r\n1961年，电脑解决了大学一年级程度的微积分题目\r\n\r\n1965年，世界上第一个用于心理治疗的聊天机器人ELIZA，尝试着和人进行对话\r\n\r\n1967年，STUDENT程序成功地解决了用文字描述的一道大学程度的代数题目\r\n\r\n1973年，Freddy机器人通过视觉感知来定位和组装了模型\r\n\r\n1974年，随着政府资助机构减少了对于人工智能研究的拨款预算，人工智能寒冬到来\r\n\r\n1975年，斯坦福大学的Meta-DENDRAL程序发现关于分子的新规律，成果被发表在了美国化学学会的期刊上\r\n\r\n1980年，自动行驶的汽车在慕尼黑大学里以90公里/小时的速度行驶\r\n\r\n1988年，人工智能的主要形式变为基于不确定数据的概率推理，而不再是以往那样侧重于逻辑\r\n\r\n1989年，美国航天局（NASA）利用自动聚类的电脑程序发现以往未知的几类恒星\r\n\r\n1997年，IBM“更深的蓝”超级电脑击败了国际象棋冠军卡斯帕罗夫\r\n\r\n1998年，由Hasbro生产的第一个人工智能的宠物Furby开始在美国出售；美国航天局（NASA）第一次有了完全由电脑程序自动控制的飞行器\r\n\r\n2000年，Nomad机器人探索南极洲的偏远地区，采集气象观测样本\r\n\r\n2004年，一个电脑程序可以比一个专业级真人飞行员更快地学会操纵遥控直升机\r\n\r\n2007年，美国艾尔伯特大学的人工智能程序完全破解了西洋跳棋游戏\r\n\r\n2011年，苹果的语音识别软件Siri可以让用户和iPhone对话；iRobot公司出售出了第600万个Roomba吸尘器机器人\r\n\r\n2012年，Google翻译做的翻译总量已经超过了所有人类翻译者所做的总合\r\n\r\n2012年，通过10亿个连接，Google的人工智能神经网络可以去识别一些常见的物体，像人脸和猫\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n日常生活中的AI\r\n\r\n你或许没有意识到，其实你每天都在和AI人工智能打交道，它们在帮你选择手机通话线路，在审核你的信用卡交易，在过滤掉诈骗垃圾e-mail和自动管理你的基金进行股票交易。它们还可以在你的数码照片中识别出你的脸，或者你在玩视频游戏的时候识别你的手势，甚至可以帮助你的医生分析化验结果，这些常见的电脑程序其实都拥有真人一样的智能。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n数据挖掘者\r\n\r\n2011年，IBM公司向世界推出了Watson，一个可以理解用日常语言提出的问题，并且可以准确地给出答案的超级计算机。Watson拥有3000个联网在一起的处理器，每个处理器可以看作是一台小型的电脑，它们一共储存着几百万份文件，Watson可以随时抽出其中的一份来帮助回答任何问题。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIBM选择了在美国一个电视问答娱乐节目Jeopardy上让Watson这个计算巨人首次登场亮相，Jeopardy节目一向以提出“拐弯抹角”的问题而出名，有点像国内的开心辞典和幸运52。这个游戏可比国际象棋复杂的多，Watson不仅需要综合所有人类知识，还需要理解节目问题中的各种文字游戏。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n在Watson在节目舞台上精彩表现的背后，人工智能的一个分支概率推理功不可没：这种推理可以在不完整的信息组合中提取出一幅完成的画面。在比赛开始前，大量的维基百科文字，网页和其他参考资料，以及以往Jeopardy节目的资料都被塞进了Watson的硬盘里。然后IBM的工程师们把Watson的电脑程序分成了100个小程序，每个小程序负责一个方面，比如一个程序会专门负责“著名作家”，另一个程序负责“食品”。当这些“各个领域的专家”搜索完了各自的数据库之后，Watson会综合这100个分程序的结果，选择出最有可能正确的答案。Watson曾经在电视节目中击败两位真人的冠军。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n不过成为Jeopardy比赛的冠军并不是Watson的真正使命，IBM计划利用Watson完成一些更加严肃的任务，比如给医学、商业、农业这些领域提供时效性很强的关键信息。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n行驶在公路上的AI\r\n\r\n在通往拉斯维加斯的公路上，如果你看到一辆汽车上面有红色的车牌和无穷大符号，就要留意一下了，这可能是一辆无人驾驶的汽车。内华达州为无人驾驶汽车发放了第一张牌照。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n在世界上其他地方，无人驾驶汽车也会火起来吗？应该说，到现在为止，驾驶还是一项仍旧由真人司机占据主导地位的任务，因为驾车虽然称不上很难，但其中有太多变量，比如正在接近你的车是以60公里每小时还是70公里每小时行驶？在角落里会不会还有一辆在你的视角之外的车？如果我想超过前面的车，前面车的司机会不会突然超速？诸如此类的问题还会有很多。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n对于人工智能来说，在公路上无人驾驶汽车还不算是最难的任务，早在1994年，两辆无人驾驶汽车就曾经在环绕巴黎的公路上行驶了1000公里。但是如果让无人驾驶汽车在城市中穿行，任务一下子就变得困难很多，城市交通中很多不成文的规则会让AI汽车摸不到头脑。比如说，如果Google的研究者严格按照司机守则为AI汽车编写程序，在十字路口上一定要为其他汽车让路，他们会发现这台太过老实的无人驾驶汽车永远也没法走过这个路口。于是，他们对程序做了一点改进，当AI汽车等待了一段时间之后，就会自动缓慢向前移动，向其他汽车示意自己想要先走，而不只是傻傻地等待。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n对于自动驾驶汽车还有一个不确定性是如何判断自己所处的位置，GPS卫星定位数据有时并不靠谱，误差会达到几米之多，AI汽车在使用GPS的同时，还会同时开启照相机、雷达和激光定位功能，共同帮助校正GPS的数据，不要让汽车越走越偏。这几项定位功能每一项都有自己的优缺点，都不是完全准确的，但是综合到一起就可以达到很高的精确度。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n除了直接驾驶汽车以外，AI还可以自动调节汽车燃料进出，节约能源。作为前沿科技的自动驾驶汽车综合了人工智能很多方面的技术，越来越被人们所接受。通过特别许可，Google的自动驾驶汽车已经在完全无人控制的情况下，在加州的公路和街区中穿行了成千上万公里。美国佛罗里达州和加州已经通过立法允许自动驾驶汽车这种新型交通工具的使用，其他许多州也在积极讨论这一事宜。\r\n\r\n垃圾邮件杀手\r\n\r\n在如今的全世界的电子邮件中，每十封恐怕有九封都是垃圾邮件，如果这些垃圾邮件和正常邮件混在一起出现在你的收件夹里，恐怕没人再会用email了。能够把垃圾邮件从正常邮件中过滤出来的人工智能领域称为机器学习。正如名字里所说，垃圾邮件过滤器可以从环境中和从邮箱的主人怎样对待邮件中学习什么是好邮件和坏邮件。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n要判断什么样的邮件才算是垃圾邮件，只要看一下每天email的使用者打开邮箱之后，把哪些邮件加上星号保留，把哪些邮件看也不看就直接删掉，这些举动为垃圾邮件过滤器提供了最好的参考。电脑程序会根据这些信息把每个邮件分解成很多个“特征”，一个特征可以是单个词，也可以是一个词组，邮件发送的时间，或者邮件是由哪一台电脑发送过来的。这些特征可以帮助电脑程序决定一封邮件是正常邮件还是垃圾邮件。比如说，一封邮件里包括了“最低价格”、“精心包装”这两个特征词组，而根据全球统计，这两个词组在垃圾邮件中出现的比率高达8%和3%，而在正常邮件中，它们出现的比例只有0.1%和0.3%。之后在假设这些词语出现的几率是独立的前提下，通过数学上的贝叶斯定律公式和上面两项特征的统计数据，计算出这封邮件是垃圾邮件的概率有99.9%之高。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n垃圾邮件过滤器最重要的事情就是根据经验不断更新它使用的邮件判定模型。再好的垃圾邮件过滤器也会有犯错误的时候，可能放过坏邮件，也可能错杀好邮件，每当邮箱的主人把一封垃圾邮件箱里的邮件移回收件夹里或者在收件夹里点一下删除的时候，垃圾邮件过滤器会立刻更正自己的参数，做出新的改进，以提高识别邮件的准确率。对于编写垃圾邮件过滤器的程序员来说，他们并不需要一步一步地制定出繁琐的邮件判别标准，只需要构建一个人工智能系统，然后通过例子和真正的email来训练这套系统，让垃圾邮件过滤AI程序自己提高自己。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n万能翻译\r\n\r\n在任何一天，Google翻译功能所翻译的文字量比全世界所有专业翻译人员每年翻译量的总合还要大。Google翻译可以在65种语言之间任意两种之间进行翻译，一共有超过4000种翻译方式。Google翻译能够运行，一定离不开人工智能的一个领域——概率推理。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n在很多年前，语言学家通过双语字典上大量的词汇和一条条的语法规则来构建自动的翻译系统。但是这样做却失败了，如此的翻译会很生硬、很不灵活。比如法语语法规则里一般形容词在名词后面，英语语法规则里一般形容词在名词前面，可是也有例外的时候，比如“the light fantastic”。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n在过去二三十年里，自动翻译依靠的不再是语言学家制定的规则，而是从现实的例子中自动学习而来的由概率支配的规则，就好像以往是通过背单词和记语法来学外语，而现在是通过身临语言环境中学习。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n自动翻译另外一个重要方面是电脑和真人之间的配合和交互，很多自动翻译系统都是先在互联网上搜集大量真人翻译过的文件作为基础。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n当然自动翻译还远远称不上完美，但是它正在逐渐改进，准确度越来越高，语言的种类也越来越多。Google正在研究一个名为Translate的Android手机小程序，每当你对手机说一句话时，这个小程序可以把你所说的话转换成任意一种语言，发送给和你通电话的人，而对方在手机上也可以说自己的语言。随着自动翻译技术的发展，一个被长久期盼的诱人目标将有机会实现——每个人不需要学习任何外语，就可以和世界各地的朋友进行交流。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n人工智能的新未来\r\n\r\n在过去半个世纪中，几个关键的发展推动着人工智能科技出现在我们的身边。如今，科学家们对于神经科学和认知科学的新认识可以让我们设计出更新的硬件和软件。互联网的发展也使得直接访问全球的海量数据变得可能。不仅如此，人工智能或许还可以自己依靠自己来进化。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n进化\r\n\r\n现今大多数的人工智能系统如果完全依靠手动来编写程序，会变得很复杂，一个另辟蹊径的方法是让电脑程序自己进化自己。在虚拟的环境中，程序通过不断的迭代，尝试变化各种参数，在不断尝试和失败之中，程序逐渐“自然而然”变成设计者期望的样子。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n首先设计者们对于程序所在的环境进行模拟，就像一个游泳池或者一片沙漠一样，比如对于垃圾邮件过滤器，“环境”就是大量的邮件，既包括正常邮件也包括垃圾邮件。然后一个人工智能AI程序的不同版本会同时在模拟的环境中进行测试，这些AI程序会给出各自不同的输出结果，输出结果的质量会被评分，分数比较好的AI程序会被进一步的修改，分数比较差的AI程序会被遗弃掉，修改后的程序有的可以进一步变得更好，有的则会不如以前，同样优胜劣汰，如此往复，最后原本几个普通程序可以自然进化成很好的人工智能系统。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n这个过程其实非常像自然界中所发生的“弱肉强食，适者生存”，而一个程序的某个参数被修改如同基因突变，两个程序还可以各取一部分交叉到一起产生一个新的程序，就如同动物交配产生后代一样，这种让电脑程序自己进化自己的方法被称为“遗传算法”。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n电脑也需要直觉\r\n\r\n人类永远不是绝对理性的，我们在做决定的时候会犯很多常见的错误，会很容易受无关细节的干扰。有的时候我们并没有经过事实判断，匆匆忙忙做出一个决定，也就是常说的“相信自己的直觉”。我们曾经觉着“冷静”的电脑不像人一样冲动，一定是件好事，可是最近的认知科学研究结果却发现事实并非如此。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n一个人先天具有两种相互配套的做决定的方式，一种是缓慢的、深思熟虑的但同时也是理性的，另一种是快速的，有爆发力的，可以把当前的情况迅速和以往的经验联系起来，一两秒钟中做出决定。第二种方式或许才是人类智能的关键。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n我们在进行深思熟虑的时候，理性必定要以耗费更多的时间和精力为代价。比如有一辆车正迎面撞向你驾驶的车，你需要立刻做出反应，或者鸣笛，或者刹车，或者转向，而不是经过复杂的计算决定哪种选择是最优的，估计等结果算出来事故已经发生了。这种快速反应在非紧急情况下也同样有使用的必要，比如你如果每天都在仔细思考到底穿深蓝色衣服还是浅蓝色衣服这样无关紧要的问题，会浪费大量的时间和精力，耽误重要的事情。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n那么人工智能中是不是也应该加入直觉的成分呢？事实上，很多现代的人工智能系统真的有两部分，一部分用于瞬时反应的情况，另外一部分用于需要更多理性分析的情况。一些机器人使用多层系统结构，最底层只做直接的反应，较高的层组织和抑制这些反应，去完成更复杂的目标。这种方式可以很有效，控制步行机器人在凹凸不平的地面上行走就是一个例子。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n另外一种类似的方式是在人工智能程序中加入一些“情感”，比如一个机器人如果反复尝试做一件事情，不断失败，一个表达“气馁”情感的电路就可以“激励”机器人寻找新的选择。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n让机器来模拟情感本身就是件很复杂的任务，人工智能的创始者之一Marvin Minsky曾经认为情感并不是人的大脑所做的一件事，而是包括了大脑的很多部分之间的相互作用，还有大脑和身体之间的相互作用。情感会驱使我们做出某些选择，如果电脑程序的某部分能够让程序变得好像被情感驱使了一样，电脑程序自然变得更像人类的智能。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n像大脑一样的机器\r\n\r\n既然我们的目标是制造一台具有人类智能的机器，为何不直接复制一下人的大脑呢？人类自己毕竟是智能的最好样本。在过去的二三十年，神经科学对于我们的大脑是怎样处理和储存信息产生了很多新的认识。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n人类的大脑是由100万亿个神经突触连接着1000亿个神经元组成的一个网络，这些神经突触和神经元会在每秒内改变10到100次状态。我们大脑的这种结构使得它非常善于完成在一张图片中识别出一个物体这样的任务。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n而一台超级计算机可以拥有100万亿字节的内存，拥有的晶体管电路的运算速度比人的大脑快1亿倍，这种结构使得计算机擅长于去快速完成明确定义、工作量大、要求精确的任务。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n这两种结构各有优缺点，不过完成很多模糊性任务的时候，人脑的结构更加占据优势，比如像识别人脸，我们并不需要进行精确计算的电路。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n相比于超级计算机，人的大脑也是一台很节能的机器，人的大脑进行各种计算的时候，大约只需要20瓦的功率，只相当于一个亮度很低的老式电灯泡。而一台进行类似计算的超级计算机所需要的能量将会是20万瓦。据统计，每天应对全球无数搜索请求，拥有很多超级计算机的Google公司每年用电可以达到23亿千瓦时（度），相当于20.7万户美国家庭一年的用电量，相当于41座帝国大厦一年用电量，一个表面上看起来并非传统重工业的公司却是个耗电大户。这使得很多研究人员尝试着模仿人的大脑制造出节能高效的电脑硬件。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n我们都知道，任何一台电脑里都需要有CPU，内存和硬盘，假设CPU是你，内存是桌子，硬盘是柜子，而程序则是那些你放在柜子里的各种书籍，文件，玩具等等，CPU负责运算和执行各个程序，硬盘储存着各个程序，如果你想看看书或者玩玩具，那得先把相应的东西从柜子里拿出来放到桌面上，然后你才可以在桌面上玩玩具或者写作业。桌子就相当于内存，是一个临时储存程序的地方。在电脑里，这三个部件缺一不可，可是在人的大脑里，我们并没有相应的这些部分，处理储存信息都是在一起同时进行的。按照传统计算机的结构，你玩完玩具想去看书，需要先把玩具从桌子放回柜子里，然后再从柜子里拿一本书拿到桌子上，完成很多个不同的任务需要一道道的工序，效率就会降低，可是大脑的结构允许你同时做很多件事情，不需要做完一件再做另外一件。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n如今很多研究人员在尝试着模仿人类大脑制造出新型的计算机：它们平行地而不是一件一件地完成任务，它们更加模拟化而不是数字化，它们虽然会慢一些但是消耗的能源也很少。"}, "commit"=>"Update Review", "department_id"=>"1", "id"=>"7"}

人工智能的概念在世界上第一台电脑出现之前的很多个世纪就已经初具端倪，亚里士多德提出的从假设得出结论的“三段论”就是一种机械式的逻辑推理方法，。按照他的理论，我们可以这样进行论述：

前提：一些天鹅是白的；所有天鹅都是鸟

结论：有一些鸟是白的。

如果用符号来表示：

前提：一些S是W，所有的S都是B

结论：有一些B是W。

无论S，W，B代表什么，也就是说无论这句话中的词语具体是什么，我们都可以得到正确的结论。根据这样的构想，我们在没有完全知道人是怎么想问题的情况下，或许就可以建立出一套智能化的工作机制。

日常生活中的AI

你或许没有意识到，其实你每天都在和AI人工智能打交道，它们在帮你选择手机通话线路，在审核你的信用卡交易，在过滤掉诈骗垃圾e-mail和自动管理你的基金进行股票交易。它们还可以在你的数码照片中识别出你的脸，或者你在玩视频游戏的时候识别你的手势，甚至可以帮助你的医生分析化验结果，这些常见的电脑程序其实都拥有真人一样的智能。

 

数据挖掘者

2011年，IBM公司向世界推出了Watson，一个可以理解用日常语言提出的问题，并且可以准确地给出答案的超级计算机。Watson拥有3000个联网在一起的处理器，每个处理器可以看作是一台小型的电脑，它们一共储存着几百万份文件，Watson可以随时抽出其中的一份来帮助回答任何问题。

 

IBM选择了在美国一个电视问答娱乐节目Jeopardy上让Watson这个计算巨人首次登场亮相，Jeopardy节目一向以提出“拐弯抹角”的问题而出名，有点像国内的开心辞典和幸运52。这个游戏可比国际象棋复杂的多，Watson不仅需要综合所有人类知识，还需要理解节目问题中的各种文字游戏。

 

在Watson在节目舞台上精彩表现的背后，人工智能的一个分支概率推理功不可没：这种推理可以在不完整的信息组合中提取出一幅完成的画面。在比赛开始前，大量的维基百科文字，网页和其他参考资料，以及以往Jeopardy节目的资料都被塞进了Watson的硬盘里。然后IBM的工程师们把Watson的电脑程序分成了100个小程序，每个小程序负责一个方面，比如一个程序会专门负责“著名作家”，另一个程序负责“食品”。当这些“各个领域的专家”搜索完了各自的数据库之后，Watson会综合这100个分程序的结果，选择出最有可能正确的答案。Watson曾经在电视节目中击败两位真人的冠军。

 

不过成为Jeopardy比赛的冠军并不是Watson的真正使命，IBM计划利用Watson完成一些更加严肃的任务，比如给医学、商业、农业这些领域提供时效性很强的关键信息。

 

行驶在公路上的AI

在通往拉斯维加斯的公路上，如果你看到一辆汽车上面有红色的车牌和无穷大符号，就要留意一下了，这可能是一辆无人驾驶的汽车。内华达州为无人驾驶汽车发放了第一张牌照。

 

在世界上其他地方，无人驾驶汽车也会火起来吗？应该说，到现在为止，驾驶还是一项仍旧由真人司机占据主导地位的任务，因为驾车虽然称不上很难，但其中有太多变量，比如正在接近你的车是以60公里每小时还是70公里每小时行驶？在角落里会不会还有一辆在你的视角之外的车？如果我想超过前面的车，前面车的司机会不会突然超速？诸如此类的问题还会有很多。

 

对于人工智能来说，在公路上无人驾驶汽车还不算是最难的任务，早在1994年，两辆无人驾驶汽车就曾经在环绕巴黎的公路上行驶了1000公里。但是如果让无人驾驶汽车在城市中穿行，任务一下子就变得困难很多，城市交通中很多不成文的规则会让AI汽车摸不到头脑。比如说，如果Google的研究者严格按照司机守则为AI汽车编写程序，在十字路口上一定要为其他汽车让路，他们会发现这台太过老实的无人驾驶汽车永远也没法走过这个路口。于是，他们对程序做了一点改进，当AI汽车等待了一段时间之后，就会自动缓慢向前移动，向其他汽车示意自己想要先走，而不只是傻傻地等待。

 

对于自动驾驶汽车还有一个不确定性是如何判断自己所处的位置，GPS卫星定位数据有时并不靠谱，误差会达到几米之多，AI汽车在使用GPS的同时，还会同时开启照相机、雷达和激光定位功能，共同帮助校正GPS的数据，不要让汽车越走越偏。这几项定位功能每一项都有自己的优缺点，都不是完全准确的，但是综合到一起就可以达到很高的精确度。

 

除了直接驾驶汽车以外，AI还可以自动调节汽车燃料进出，节约能源。作为前沿科技的自动驾驶汽车综合了人工智能很多方面的技术，越来越被人们所接受。通过特别许可，Google的自动驾驶汽车已经在完全无人控制的情况下，在加州的公路和街区中穿行了成千上万公里。美国佛罗里达州和加州已经通过立法允许自动驾驶汽车这种新型交通工具的使用，其他许多州也在积极讨论这一事宜。

垃圾邮件杀手

在如今的全世界的电子邮件中，每十封恐怕有九封都是垃圾邮件，如果这些垃圾邮件和正常邮件混在一起出现在你的收件夹里，恐怕没人再会用email了。能够把垃圾邮件从正常邮件中过滤出来的人工智能领域称为机器学习。正如名字里所说，垃圾邮件过滤器可以从环境中和从邮箱的主人怎样对待邮件中学习什么是好邮件和坏邮件。

 

要判断什么样的邮件才算是垃圾邮件，只要看一下每天email的使用者打开邮箱之后，把哪些邮件加上星号保留，把哪些邮件看也不看就直接删掉，这些举动为垃圾邮件过滤器提供了最好的参考。电脑程序会根据这些信息把每个邮件分解成很多个“特征”，一个特征可以是单个词，也可以是一个词组，邮件发送的时间，或者邮件是由哪一台电脑发送过来的。这些特征可以帮助电脑程序决定一封邮件是正常邮件还是垃圾邮件。比如说，一封邮件里包括了“最低价格”、“精心包装”这两个特征词组，而根据全球统计，这两个词组在垃圾邮件中出现的比率高达8%和3%，而在正常邮件中，它们出现的比例只有0.1%和0.3%。之后在假设这些词语出现的几率是独立的前提下，通过数学上的贝叶斯定律公式和上面两项特征的统计数据，计算出这封邮件是垃圾邮件的概率有99.9%之高。

 

垃圾邮件过滤器最重要的事情就是根据经验不断更新它使用的邮件判定模型。再好的垃圾邮件过滤器也会有犯错误的时候，可能放过坏邮件，也可能错杀好邮件，每当邮箱的主人把一封垃圾邮件箱里的邮件移回收件夹里或者在收件夹里点一下删除的时候，垃圾邮件过滤器会立刻更正自己的参数，做出新的改进，以提高识别邮件的准确率。对于编写垃圾邮件过滤器的程序员来说，他们并不需要一步一步地制定出繁琐的邮件判别标准，只需要构建一个人工智能系统，然后通过例子和真正的email来训练这套系统，让垃圾邮件过滤AI程序自己提高自己。

 

万能翻译

在任何一天，Google翻译功能所翻译的文字量比全世界所有专业翻译人员每年翻译量的总合还要大。Google翻译可以在65种语言之间任意两种之间进行翻译，一共有超过4000种翻译方式。Google翻译能够运行，一定离不开人工智能的一个领域——概率推理。

 

在很多年前，语言学家通过双语字典上大量的词汇和一条条的语法规则来构建自动的翻译系统。但是这样做却失败了，如此的翻译会很生硬、很不灵活。比如法语语法规则里一般形容词在名词后面，英语语法规则里一般形容词在名词前面，可是也有例外的时候，比如“the light fantastic”。

 

在过去二三十年里，自动翻译依靠的不再是语言学家制定的规则，而是从现实的例子中自动学习而来的由概率支配的规则，就好像以往是通过背单词和记语法来学外语，而现在是通过身临语言环境中学习。

 

自动翻译另外一个重要方面是电脑和真人之间的配合和交互，很多自动翻译系统都是先在互联网上搜集大量真人翻译过的文件作为基础。

 

当然自动翻译还远远称不上完美，但是它正在逐渐改进，准确度越来越高，语言的种类也越来越多。Google正在研究一个名为Translate的Android手机小程序，每当你对手机说一句话时，这个小程序可以把你所说的话转换成任意一种语言，发送给和你通电话的人，而对方在手机上也可以说自己的语言。随着自动翻译技术的发展，一个被长久期盼的诱人目标将有机会实现——每个人不需要学习任何外语，就可以和世界各地的朋友进行交流。

 

人工智能的新未来

在过去半个世纪中，几个关键的发展推动着人工智能科技出现在我们的身边。如今，科学家们对于神经科学和认知科学的新认识可以让我们设计出更新的硬件和软件。互联网的发展也使得直接访问全球的海量数据变得可能。不仅如此，人工智能或许还可以自己依靠自己来进化。

 

进化

现今大多数的人工智能系统如果完全依靠手动来编写程序，会变得很复杂，一个另辟蹊径的方法是让电脑程序自己进化自己。在虚拟的环境中，程序通过不断的迭代，尝试变化各种参数，在不断尝试和失败之中，程序逐渐“自然而然”变成设计者期望的样子。

 

首先设计者们对于程序所在的环境进行模拟，就像一个游泳池或者一片沙漠一样，比如对于垃圾邮件过滤器，“环境”就是大量的邮件，既包括正常邮件也包括垃圾邮件。然后一个人工智能AI程序的不同版本会同时在模拟的环境中进行测试，这些AI程序会给出各自不同的输出结果，输出结果的质量会被评分，分数比较好的AI程序会被进一步的修改，分数比较差的AI程序会被遗弃掉，修改后的程序有的可以进一步变得更好，有的则会不如以前，同样优胜劣汰，如此往复，最后原本几个普通程序可以自然进化成很好的人工智能系统。

 

这个过程其实非常像自然界中所发生的“弱肉强食，适者生存”，而一个程序的某个参数被修改如同基因突变，两个程序还可以各取一部分交叉到一起产生一个新的程序，就如同动物交配产生后代一样，这种让电脑程序自己进化自己的方法被称为“遗传算法”。

 

电脑也需要直觉

人类永远不是绝对理性的，我们在做决定的时候会犯很多常见的错误，会很容易受无关细节的干扰。有的时候我们并没有经过事实判断，匆匆忙忙做出一个决定，也就是常说的“相信自己的直觉”。我们曾经觉着“冷静”的电脑不像人一样冲动，一定是件好事，可是最近的认知科学研究结果却发现事实并非如此。

 

一个人先天具有两种相互配套的做决定的方式，一种是缓慢的、深思熟虑的但同时也是理性的，另一种是快速的，有爆发力的，可以把当前的情况迅速和以往的经验联系起来，一两秒钟中做出决定。第二种方式或许才是人类智能的关键。

 

我们在进行深思熟虑的时候，理性必定要以耗费更多的时间和精力为代价。比如有一辆车正迎面撞向你驾驶的车，你需要立刻做出反应，或者鸣笛，或者刹车，或者转向，而不是经过复杂的计算决定哪种选择是最优的，估计等结果算出来事故已经发生了。这种快速反应在非紧急情况下也同样有使用的必要，比如你如果每天都在仔细思考到底穿深蓝色衣服还是浅蓝色衣服这样无关紧要的问题，会浪费大量的时间和精力，耽误重要的事情。

 

那么人工智能中是不是也应该加入直觉的成分呢？事实上，很多现代的人工智能系统真的有两部分，一部分用于瞬时反应的情况，另外一部分用于需要更多理性分析的情况。一些机器人使用多层系统结构，最底层只做直接的反应，较高的层组织和抑制这些反应，去完成更复杂的目标。这种方式可以很有效，控制步行机器人在凹凸不平的地面上行走就是一个例子。

 

另外一种类似的方式是在人工智能程序中加入一些“情感”，比如一个机器人如果反复尝试做一件事情，不断失败，一个表达“气馁”情感的电路就可以“激励”机器人寻找新的选择。

 

让机器来模拟情感本身就是件很复杂的任务，人工智能的创始者之一Marvin Minsky曾经认为情感并不是人的大脑所做的一件事，而是包括了大脑的很多部分之间的相互作用，还有大脑和身体之间的相互作用。情感会驱使我们做出某些选择，如果电脑程序的某部分能够让程序变得好像被情感驱使了一样，电脑程序自然变得更像人类的智能。

 

像大脑一样的机器

既然我们的目标是制造一台具有人类智能的机器，为何不直接复制一下人的大脑呢？人类自己毕竟是智能的最好样本。在过去的二三十年，神经科学对于我们的大脑是怎样处理和储存信息产生了很多新的认识。

 

人类的大脑是由100万亿个神经突触连接着1000亿个神经元组成的一个网络，这些神经突触和神经元会在每秒内改变10到100次状态。我们大脑的这种结构使得它非常善于完成在一张图片中识别出一个物体这样的任务。

 

而一台超级计算机可以拥有100万亿字节的内存，拥有的晶体管电路的运算速度比人的大脑快1亿倍，这种结构使得计算机擅长于去快速完成明确定义、工作量大、要求精确的任务。

 

这两种结构各有优缺点，不过完成很多模糊性任务的时候，人脑的结构更加占据优势，比如像识别人脸，我们并不需要进行精确计算的电路。

 

相比于超级计算机，人的大脑也是一台很节能的机器，人的大脑进行各种计算的时候，大约只需要20瓦的功率，只相当于一个亮度很低的老式电灯泡。而一台进行类似计算的超级计算机所需要的能量将会是20万瓦。据统计，每天应对全球无数搜索请求，拥有很多超级计算机的Google公司每年用电可以达到23亿千瓦时（度），相当于20.7万户美国家庭一年的用电量，相当于41座帝国大厦一年用电量，一个表面上看起来并非传统重工业的公司却是个耗电大户。这使得很多研究人员尝试着模仿人的大脑制造出节能高效的电脑硬件。

 

我们都知道，任何一台电脑里都需要有CPU，内存和硬盘，假设CPU是你，内存是桌子，硬盘是柜子，而程序则是那些你放在柜子里的各种书籍，文件，玩具等等，CPU负责运算和执行各个程序，硬盘储存着各个程序，如果你想看看书或者玩玩具，那得先把相应的东西从柜子里拿出来放到桌面上，然后你才可以在桌面上玩玩具或者写作业。桌子就相当于内存，是一个临时储存程序的地方。在电脑里，这三个部件缺一不可，可是在人的大脑里，我们并没有相应的这些部分，处理储存信息都是在一起同时进行的。按照传统计算机的结构，你玩完玩具想去看书，需要先把玩具从桌子放回柜子里，然后再从柜子里拿一本书拿到桌子上，完成很多个不同的任务需要一道道的工序，效率就会降低，可是大脑的结构允许你同时做很多件事情，不需要做完一件再做另外一件。

 

如今很多研究人员在尝试着模仿人类大脑制造出新型的计算机：它们平行地而不是一件一件地完成任务，它们更加模拟化而不是数字化，它们虽然会慢一些但是消耗的能源也很少。', "updated_at" = '2013-06-28 15:32:15.141366' WHERE "reviews"."id" = 7[0m

  Parameters: {"utf8"=>"✓", "authenticity_token"=>"M/jVKDkA9Eo9reS+Tgd8L0fXwicvjwZDaIC+VVKXN7M=", "review"=>{"title"=>"假如编程语言是女人", "creator"=>"", "content"=>"计算机语言的实质其实是为了让人类能够更好与计算机打交道，最终结果都是通过编译成二进制代码或通过解释器转译成二进制代码的形式，由计算机来执行。而二进制就是0和1，假设1代表男人，0代表女人，那么瞬间就可以发现世界就变成了一台大“计算机”。而爱情和情爱也可以看成是1和0组成的二进制机器码。\r\n\r\n假如女人是一种编程语言，也许每个男人心中都有自己最喜欢的那一个吧？我认为女人可分两类，“面向过程”和“面向对象”。“面向对象”的女人以寻找终身伴侣为目标，而“面向过程”的，则以经历难以忘怀的爱情时光为己任。各位程序猿当然也要按需选择最适合自己的“编程语言”，不要因为时髦而盲目追求“面向对象“，有时候过程可能比结果更重要。\r\n\r\n当然了，“编程”还有多种“范式”（Fashion）可以遵循。各种语言也都有自己独特的“范式”。女人无数种，这里按流行的占星学星座（即不包括蛇夫座）分类，浅表一二。\r\n\r\n白羊女——Basic语言\r\n这是一种很简单直白的语言，很多80后程序员的启蒙语言。当然也有很多变种，比如VB的初级白痴，QBasic的清朗直率，Small Basic的小巧精致。和这种“语言”相处，过程很重要，时时保持一个漂亮的“结构化编程”很重要，不要过于追求”面向对象”，最后反而得不偿失。Basic是很容易“编译”成二进制的语言，虽然没有那么强的“底层”需求但也要防止“乱”代码，遗憾的是这只能靠程序猿自觉了。\r\n\r\n金牛女——Perl语言\r\n她想让自己兼有C语言、Shell、awk等等语言的优势，然而用后却发现有点四不像且反而增加了程序猿的压力。同时，这是一种有点自伤的语言，将自由给了程序猿却把伤害深深埋在心底。需要程序猿不断调整“编程”思路，不断更新“编程范式”，给出最佳的解决算法。总而言之，这是一个需要精心照顾的“语言”，永远不要让这只“骆驼”饥渴！\r\n\r\n双子女——Shell脚本\r\n她很强大，某些时候甚至超过C语言。她也很脆弱，也许一个简单的“rm -fr / usr”（注意那个空格）就能带来毁灭性打击。她可以完成输入输出双向重定向。她可以绝对的“面向过程”，过程的每个细节都要精心推敲，花样百出；同样也可以绝对的“面向对象”，让每一次coding都如家搬温暖，常常一些“变量”更容易让整个“编程”效率倍增。别忘了Makefile的本质也是一个Shell脚本，所以增加一个叫做Love:的目标吧，然后在命令行下郑重地运行：\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n$ Make Love\r\n\r\n巨蟹女——LISP语言\r\n实话实说，这真的是一个又小众又“闷骚”的语言。也许和它的发明者麦卡锡博士的个性有关。说她小众，是因为使用Lisp进行开发的人少之又少，很多初学者都会被她敏感的神经吓跑，从Emacs的用户量就可以看出Lisp只能是有特定品味的人的掌上明珠，而一旦掌握Lisp就会发现真的是乐趣无穷而安全感倍增。至于说她“闷骚”，因为发现她具有一种内在而强大的“智能”，不要被她平时简单质朴的外形所迷惑，一旦其发挥出自己的能力，可以产生巨大的影响力或者破坏力，当然这种破坏力往往是自损。总之，在她温婉圆滑、如诗般清纯的外表下，是一颗闷骚率性且豪放不羁的心。\r\n\r\n狮子女——JAVA语言\r\n很多人都在使用JAVA，自从诞生以来就以绝对的霸气让全球的互联网都天天侧漏。而JAVA更是曾经长期霸占编程语言流行榜首位。JAVA的卖点之一是平台无关性，但不要忘了为了运行JAVA的代码需要一个非常耗费系统资源的虚拟机！最生气的是，必须强制安装平台相关的“虚拟机”才可运行。那么，这样霸气甚至是不讲道理的“语言”何以如此流行？因为她让那些自视甚高的程序猿找到了一种发泄的渠道，认为一旦征服了JAVA就可以天下无敌了。却没想到其实内心依然是个自卑的人。\r\n\r\n处女女——Pascal语言\r\n很多70后的程序猿是学Pascal入门的，这种架构化严谨而独特的语言，让很多人学会了严谨的科学态度。但是不要忘了，这样严谨甚至苛刻的语言，吓跑了很多向往自由和风格不羁的程序猿。更重要的是她独特挑剔的品味，敏感细腻的风格，以及纠结啰嗦的“编译环境”都让很多人望而却步，且Verbose模式常常打击人的成就感。在“编译”二进制和“底层”需求方面，她保守而不讲人情，甚至条件苛刻，往往一次莫名其妙的Error仅仅只是因为你糟糕的Coding Style。\r\n\r\n天枰女——Ruby语言\r\nRuby是红宝石的意思，所以这样的女人也如此，看起来像红宝石一样高贵典雅，其实外强中干。不仅运行性能较差，而且应用领域多限于互联网应用，更无奈的是她完全“面向对象”，对过程一概忽略。和这样的“语言”相处，最重要的也许是给她以虚幻的红宝石幻象，让她时刻保有高贵典雅的气质，避免暴露出外强中干的实质，更要防止暴露出她为了提高性能，而提出的过高“底层”需求。\r\n\r\n天蝎女——C语言\r\n这是一个令人着迷的“语言”，也是一个难度很大的“语言”，即使是一个Hello World也是一系列库、源程序经过编译、链接以后的结果。最关键的是，她的魅力就在于其可以通过“指针”直接满足“底层”需求，当她有高涨的”底层需求”时，绝对不能给她一个“NULL指针”或者是“野指针”，否则她随时会给你”段错误“的！同时她也是一个自由度很高的“语言”，令人完全无从知道她的真实意思，也许只有真正运行之后才能知晓。所以能够完全驾驭”C语言”的往往都是操作”指针“非常熟练，”底层”需求高涨且频繁，更是保有无尽解谜热情的程序猿。\r\n\r\n射手女——C++\r\n首先她具有以上C语言的全部特征，这还不是最悲剧的。她更强调“面向对象”，如果为了得到她而做得不伦不“类”的话，就只能是一个只满足”底层“需求的玩物。但是她却有执着不懈的”继承“追求，而为了成为她的”对象“，必须读懂她“封装”的心，和她“多态”的世界，还有无尽的”模板“和“命名空间”来规范生活，看上去很有品味与追求。她几乎是最难驾驭的，CoolShell的陈皓曾有文章《你真的懂C++吗？》，也许看起来懂了，其实最多只是一知半解而已，当然她也饱受如此无人理解之苦。而为了驾驭她，各位程序猿前赴后继研究出了STL、Boost、“泛型”在内的多种开发模式，可是效果如何呢？\r\n\r\n魔羯女——Lua语言\r\n她是一个可扩展配置的语言，可内嵌在任何宿主之内。可是如果想完全收入心中，要么具有如Angry Birds那样的创意和娱乐，要么就如魔兽世界这样影响无穷。但她却不肯甘做附属和贤内助，往往要冲上前台一展身手。却暴露了她功能不多，内涵浅薄的弱点。外加“底层”功能太少，让程序猿只能“撸阿”。\r\n\r\n水瓶女——Python语言\r\n她斑斓丰富的世界吸引了很多向往的人，外加需求和品味的独特更是让人格外着迷。不过她古怪的空格式语法让人颇有些摸不着头脑。还有她独特的运行库更是拖慢了本可以快速运行的“爱情应用”。随着时间的推移，缓慢的效率已经将她清晰意读的性格和丰富多彩的功能，击的粉碎。所以和她相处，不仅要尽量少的与环境打交道，更重要的是快速拿下，避免夜长梦多。\r\n\r\n双鱼女——Go语言\r\n这是一种绝对可以并行使用的“语言”，兼有C语言的特征，而“底层需求”虽然不如C语言那么灵活和精于指针，但绝对“引用”了丰富的“底层”内容。更重要的是她丰富的“接口”功能，让你在享受“面向过程”的同时向往着“面向对象”的未来。只是她有时显得不合时宜的孩子气和不成熟，会稍有影响整体感情，不过总是有个未来的盼头的。\r\n\r\nPHP是你的豆蔻年华的心上人，她是情窦初开的你今年夏天傻乎乎的追求的目标。玩一玩可以，但千万不要投入过深，因为这个女孩有严重的问题。\r\n\r\nPerl 是PHP的姐姐。她对你来说年龄稍微大了一点，但在90年代，她是相当受欢迎的。她和Larry Wall(译注：Perl语言创始人)长期保持着亲密关系，因此她的审美一落千丈，如今她看起来是丑陋不堪。“无论你们怎么评论，我仍然爱她！”，Larry Wall说。没有第二个人会像他这样。\r\n\r\nRuby是脚本家族中一个非常漂亮的孩子。第一眼看她，你的心魄就会被她的美丽摄走。她还很有有趣。起初她看起来有点慢，不怎么稳定，但近些年来她已经成熟了很多。\r\n\r\nPython 是Ruby的一个更懂事的姐姐。她优雅，新潮，成熟。她也许太过优秀。很多小伙都会说“嘿，兄弟，你怎么可能不爱上Python呢！？”。没错，你喜欢Python。你把她当成了一个脾气和浪漫都退烧了的Ruby。\r\n\r\nJava是一个事业成功的女人。很多在她手下干过的人都感觉她的能力跟她的地位并不般配，她更多的是通过技巧打动了中层管理人员。你也许会认为她是很有智慧的人，你愿意跟随她。但你要准备好在数年里不断的听到“你用错了接口，你遗漏了一个分号”这样的责备。\r\n\r\nC++ 是Java的表姐。她在很多地方跟Java类似，不同的是她成长于一个天真的年代，不认为需要使用“保护措施”。当然，“保护措施”是指自动内存管理。你以为我指的是什么？ \r\n\r\nC 是C++的妈妈。对一些头发花白的老程序员说起这个名称，会让他们眼睛一亮，产生无限回忆。\r\n\r\nObjective C C语言家族的另外一个成员。她加入了一个奇怪的教会，不愿意和任何教会之外的人约会。\r\n\r\nHaskell, Clojure, Scheme 以及她们的朋友们都是一些时髦的，附庸风雅的，很聪明的女孩，你也许在多年前和她们曾度过了一个很Happy的暑假。她们是第一次让你感到有压力的女孩。当然，你可能从来没有对她们很认真——尽管你总是在问自己“如果….会如何？”\r\n\r\n也许你会拖延着不去认识C# ，因为她们家族不好的名声。但最近几年他们已经改邪归正了——他们会这样告诉你。一旦你加入我们，你就是我们的人了，你听到了没有？你需要一个数据库？她的哥哥MSSQL会罩着你。需要一个安身的地方？这有何难，她老爸甚至可以在Azure大道你给买一套公寓。什么？你觉得这样的关系过于亲密了？不，你别想离开我们。你已经是我们家族的一员了，现在，听见了没有？\r\n\r\nJavascript —— 嗨，这不是你的初吻的那个女孩吗，她甚至比PHP更早进入你的视线。我不知道她现在在干什么。我听说她的事业近几年来非常成功。旧时的人也可以赶上潮流变得很酷….（你发现她从头到脚穿的都是设计师jQuery的作品）….哇，有人从丑小鸭变成了美丽的天鹅…"}, "commit"=>"Create Review", "department_id"=>"1"}

很多人都用过Google 图片搜索功能。你可以用一张图片，搜索互联网上所有与它相似的图片。

你输入网片的网址，或者直接上传图片，Google就会找出与其相似的图片。下面这张图片是美国女演员Alyson Hannigan。



上传后，Google返回如下结果：



这种技术的原理是什么？计算机怎么知道两张图片相似呢？

根据Neal Krawetz博士的解释，原理非常简单易懂。我们可以用一个快速算法，就达到基本的效果。

这里的关键技术叫做"感知哈希算法"（Perceptual hash algorithm），它的作用是对每张图片生成一个"指纹"（fingerprint）字符串，然后比较不同图片的指纹。结果越接近，就说明图片越相似。

下面是一个最简单的实现：

第一步，缩小尺寸。

将图片缩小到8x8的尺寸，总共64个像素。这一步的作用是去除图片的细节，只保留结构、明暗等基本信息，摒弃不同尺寸、比例带来的图片差异。

 

第二步，简化色彩。

将缩小后的图片，转为64级灰度。也就是说，所有像素点总共只有64种颜色。

第三步，计算平均值。

计算所有64个像素的灰度平均值。

第四步，比较像素的灰度。

将每个像素的灰度，与平均值进行比较。大于或等于平均值，记为1；小于平均值，记为0。

第五步，计算哈希值。

将上一步的比较结果，组合在一起，就构成了一个64位的整数，这就是这张图片的指纹。组合的次序并不重要，只要保证所有图片都采用同样次序就行了。



得到指纹以后，就可以对比不同的图片，看看64位中有多少位是不一样的。在理论上，这等同于计算"汉明距离"（Hamming distance）。如果不相同的数据位不超过5，就说明两张图片很相似；如果大于10，就说明这是两张不同的图片。

具体的代码实现，可以参见Wote用python语言写的imgHash.py。代码很短，只有53行。使用的时候，第一个参数是基准图片，第二个参数是用来比较的其他图片所在的目录，返回结果是两张图片之间不相同的数据位数量（汉明距离）。

这种算法的优点是简单快速，不受图片大小缩放的影响，缺点是图片的内容不能变更。如果在图片上加几个文字，它就认不出来了。所以，它的最佳用途是根据缩略图，找出原图。

实际应用中，往往采用更强大的pHash算法和SIFT算法，它们能够识别图片的变形。只要变形程度不超过25%，它们就能匹配原图。这些算法虽然更复杂，但是原理与上面的简便算法是一样的，就是先将图片转化成Hash字符串，然后再进行比较。', "updated_at" = '2013-06-28 16:09:38.782461' WHERE "reviews"."id" = 9[0m

text](http://fmn.xnpic.com/fmn056/20130330/0950/b_large_YD54_0788000018211261.jpg)\r\n \r\n\r\n提起人工智能(Artificial Intelliegnce,AI)，很多人会首先想起斯皮尔伯格导演的曾获2002年奥斯卡奖的科幻电影AI，在电影里一对夫妇领养了一个机器人作为自己的孩子，这个机器人可以像人一样思考，具有喜怒哀乐，在它的身上发生了许许多多的故事。这样的科幻情景离现实又有多远呢？我们不妨先从人工智能的起源谈起。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n人工智能一直是人们的追求\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n在历史上，我们一直觉着智能不只是人类所独有的，可以像人类一样进行推理和学习的机器是完全可能被制造出来的，然而事情却不像想的那样简单。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n什么是人工智能？\r\n\r\n在百科全书上，人工智能的定义是“有关可以智能地工作的机器的科学和工程”。不过一个令人纠结的问题是：到底什么是智能？即便那些“不智能”的机器在很多时候已经比我们聪明了，比如普通的计算机程序可以将成千上万个数字相乘，可以记录下银行大量余额款项，这已经超出了普通人的能力，可是他们只是能够大量重复做同一件事情，而且给出了正确的结果而已，还称不上真正的“智能”。只有某些人类特有的能力，像认出一张熟悉的脸，指挥繁忙时段的交通或者学会一件乐器，才有资格称得上“智能”。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n为什么让一台机器做这些事情这么难？这是因为，一般程序员在给电脑编写程序之前知道他想让电脑做的任务是什么，可是在人工智能领域我们要求电脑做正确的事情，可同时又不是很清楚事情到底是什么。比如我们让电脑去识别人脸，可是我们人类自己也不是完全清楚大脑在识别人脸的时候到底是怎么样工作的。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n在现实世界中，我们要面对种种不确定性，比如你在做一件事情的时候，一个竞争对手突然出现，阻止你达到目标；你在驾车的时候，有时会转动方向盘改变车的方向，避免撞上其他的车，但是这样做是不是一定安全，只有天知道；或者在正在完成一项任务的过程中，突然来了一条新消息，需要随机应变。一个人工智能的电脑程序不能仅仅按照既定的计划完成任务，需要处理类似上面这样的所有不确定性的情形。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n为了模拟人类的智能，电脑程序不仅要模拟完成的任务本身，还要为这个任务所处的世界建立模型。他必须感知到周围环境的变化，并且做出反应，相应的改变和调整自己的行动。只有一台机器可以在不确定的条件下做出正确的决定，才称得上智能。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n哲学起源\r\n\r\n人工智能的概念在世界上第一台电脑出现之前的很多个世纪就已经初具端倪，亚里士多德提出的从假设得出结论的“三段论”就是一种机械式的逻辑推理方法，。按照他的理论，我们可以这样进行论述：\r\n\r\n前提：一些天鹅是白的；所有天鹅都是鸟\r\n\r\n结论：有一些鸟是白的。\r\n\r\n如果用符号来表示：\r\n\r\n前提：一些S是W，所有的S都是B\r\n\r\n结论：有一些B是W。\r\n\r\n无论S，W，B代表什么，也就是说无论这句话中的词语具体是什么，我们都可以得到正确的结论。根据这样的构想，我们在没有完全知道人是怎么想问题的情况下，或许就可以建立出一套智能化的工作机制。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n亚里斯多德的构想为探寻人工智能的本质奠定了基础。然而直到二十世纪中期，电脑才变得足够复杂，能够去真正测试一下这些构想。1948年英国布里斯托尔大学的研究人员Grey Walter制造了一些可以移动，可以感光，可以学习的机器乌龟。其中有一个叫Elsie的机器乌龟可以自动地对环境做出反应，比如当电池电量快耗尽的时候它就会自动地降低对光线的敏感度。这些复杂的行为使得这只机械乌龟看起来不仅仅是个机器人，而是像自然界的动物一样，会做出我们预料不到的举动。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n在1950年，天才图灵提出，如果电脑和一个人可以谈话自如，我们应该“礼貌地”接受电脑可以思考的现实。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n不过直到1956年，人工智能这个词语才正式被提出。在美国达特茅斯学院的一个暑期工作坊上，这个领域的早期创始者们共同提出了他们的愿景：如果学习的各种方式和智能各个侧面都可以从理论上进行精确描述，这样一台机器就可以模拟人的一切。按照这样的目标快速发展，似乎拥有真人一般智能的机器早晚会出现。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**化整为零**\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n在二十世纪六十年代的时候，人工智能研究人员满怀梦想，信心十足，觉着他们将会在几十年的时间内实现他们的目标，就像在航天领域从第一架喷气式飞机到人类登上月球也只用了30年。为什么人工智能不可以拥有这样火箭般的发展速度呢？\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n不过两者之间最大的不同之处在于，对于人工智能，我们找不到像F=ma和E=mc^2那样既简洁又决定一切的公式。到了八十年代，研究者意识到他们既没有足够硬件也没有足够的知识来模拟人可以做的所有事情，于是整个领域分成了很多个部分。以往研究者的共同的目标是制造一台拥有人类智慧的电脑，取而代之的是，研究者侧重于去研究这个宏大问题的某个侧面，比如语音识别，计算机视觉，概率推理-甚至仅仅是国际象棋这个小领域。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n在每个领域内，研究者都取得了可喜的进步。在1997年，IBM“更深的蓝”电脑击败了国际象棋冠军卡斯帕罗夫。“更深的蓝”电脑在决定下一步怎么走棋的时候，在一秒的时间内就可以计算出两亿种不同的可能性。这使得电脑棋手可以在下一步棋之前事先推算出之后很多很多步棋可能出现的各种情况，来决定哪种局面是对自己最有利的。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“更深的蓝”电脑可以在一项需要高度智能的游戏中取得引人瞩目的胜利，然而，这位“专家”的技能有点太单一了，除了赢得一场象棋比赛以外，它什么都不会做，既不能和别人讨论他在下棋的时候使用过的策略，也不能玩其他的游戏，它尽管赢了世界大师，但是没有人会把它错当作真人，它还仅仅是一台电脑。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n人工智能的时间线：\r\n\r\n1950年 图灵提出，经过编程的电子计算机可以像真人一样回答问题\r\n\r\n1956年 在美国达特茅斯学院的一个暑期工作坊上，这个领域的早期创始者们正式提出了“人工智能”这个词汇\r\n\r\n1958年 Allen Newell和Herbert Simon预测在十年内，电脑可以击败国际象棋世界冠军，不过在现实中这整整花了四十年。\r\n\r\n1961年，电脑解决了大学一年级程度的微积分题目\r\n\r\n1965年，世界上第一个用于心理治疗的聊天机器人ELIZA，尝试着和人进行对话\r\n\r\n1967年，STUDENT程序成功地解决了用文字描述的一道大学程度的代数题目\r\n\r\n1973年，Freddy机器人通过视觉感知来定位和组装了模型\r\n\r\n1974年，随着政府资助机构减少了对于人工智能研究的拨款预算，人工智能寒冬到来\r\n\r\n1975年，斯坦福大学的Meta-DENDRAL程序发现关于分子的新规律，成果被发表在了美国化学学会的期刊上\r\n\r\n1980年，自动行驶的汽车在慕尼黑大学里以90公里/小时的速度行驶\r\n\r\n1988年，人工智能的主要形式变为基于不确定数据的概率推理，而不再是以往那样侧重于逻辑\r\n\r\n1989年，美国航天局（NASA）利用自动聚类的电脑程序发现以往未知的几类恒星\r\n\r\n1997年，IBM“更深的蓝”超级电脑击败了国际象棋冠军卡斯帕罗夫\r\n\r\n1998年，由Hasbro生产的第一个人工智能的宠物Furby开始在美国出售；美国航天局（NASA）第一次有了完全由电脑程序自动控制的飞行器\r\n\r\n2000年，Nomad机器人探索南极洲的偏远地区，采集气象观测样本\r\n\r\n2004年，一个电脑程序可以比一个专业级真人飞行员更快地学会操纵遥控直升机\r\n\r\n2007年，美国艾尔伯特大学的人工智能程序完全破解了西洋跳棋游戏\r\n\r\n2011年，苹果的语音识别软件Siri可以让用户和iPhone对话；iRobot公司出售出了第600万个Roomba吸尘器机器人\r\n\r\n2012年，Google翻译做的翻译总量已经超过了所有人类翻译者所做的总合\r\n\r\n2012年，通过10亿个连接，Google的人工智能神经网络可以去识别一些常见的物体，像人脸和猫\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n日常生活中的AI\r\n\r\n你或许没有意识到，其实你每天都在和AI人工智能打交道，它们在帮你选择手机通话线路，在审核你的信用卡交易，在过滤掉诈骗垃圾e-mail和自动管理你的基金进行股票交易。它们还可以在你的数码照片中识别出你的脸，或者你在玩视频游戏的时候识别你的手势，甚至可以帮助你的医生分析化验结果，这些常见的电脑程序其实都拥有真人一样的智能。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n数据挖掘者\r\n\r\n2011年，IBM公司向世界推出了Watson，一个可以理解用日常语言提出的问题，并且可以准确地给出答案的超级计算机。Watson拥有3000个联网在一起的处理器，每个处理器可以看作是一台小型的电脑，它们一共储存着几百万份文件，Watson可以随时抽出其中的一份来帮助回答任何问题。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIBM选择了在美国一个电视问答娱乐节目Jeopardy上让Watson这个计算巨人首次登场亮相，Jeopardy节目一向以提出“拐弯抹角”的问题而出名，有点像国内的开心辞典和幸运52。这个游戏可比国际象棋复杂的多，Watson不仅需要综合所有人类知识，还需要理解节目问题中的各种文字游戏。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n在Watson在节目舞台上精彩表现的背后，人工智能的一个分支概率推理功不可没：这种推理可以在不完整的信息组合中提取出一幅完成的画面。在比赛开始前，大量的维基百科文字，网页和其他参考资料，以及以往Jeopardy节目的资料都被塞进了Watson的硬盘里。然后IBM的工程师们把Watson的电脑程序分成了100个小程序，每个小程序负责一个方面，比如一个程序会专门负责“著名作家”，另一个程序负责“食品”。当这些“各个领域的专家”搜索完了各自的数据库之后，Watson会综合这100个分程序的结果，选择出最有可能正确的答案。Watson曾经在电视节目中击败两位真人的冠军。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n不过成为Jeopardy比赛的冠军并不是Watson的真正使命，IBM计划利用Watson完成一些更加严肃的任务，比如给医学、商业、农业这些领域提供时效性很强的关键信息。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n行驶在公路上的AI\r\n\r\n在通往拉斯维加斯的公路上，如果你看到一辆汽车上面有红色的车牌和无穷大符号，就要留意一下了，这可能是一辆无人驾驶的汽车。内华达州为无人驾驶汽车发放了第一张牌照。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n在世界上其他地方，无人驾驶汽车也会火起来吗？应该说，到现在为止，驾驶还是一项仍旧由真人司机占据主导地位的任务，因为驾车虽然称不上很难，但其中有太多变量，比如正在接近你的车是以60公里每小时还是70公里每小时行驶？在角落里会不会还有一辆在你的视角之外的车？如果我想超过前面的车，前面车的司机会不会突然超速？诸如此类的问题还会有很多。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n对于人工智能来说，在公路上无人驾驶汽车还不算是最难的任务，早在1994年，两辆无人驾驶汽车就曾经在环绕巴黎的公路上行驶了1000公里。但是如果让无人驾驶汽车在城市中穿行，任务一下子就变得困难很多，城市交通中很多不成文的规则会让AI汽车摸不到头脑。比如说，如果Google的研究者严格按照司机守则为AI汽车编写程序，在十字路口上一定要为其他汽车让路，他们会发现这台太过老实的无人驾驶汽车永远也没法走过这个路口。于是，他们对程序做了一点改进，当AI汽车等待了一段时间之后，就会自动缓慢向前移动，向其他汽车示意自己想要先走，而不只是傻傻地等待。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n对于自动驾驶汽车还有一个不确定性是如何判断自己所处的位置，GPS卫星定位数据有时并不靠谱，误差会达到几米之多，AI汽车在使用GPS的同时，还会同时开启照相机、雷达和激光定位功能，共同帮助校正GPS的数据，不要让汽车越走越偏。这几项定位功能每一项都有自己的优缺点，都不是完全准确的，但是综合到一起就可以达到很高的精确度。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n除了直接驾驶汽车以外，AI还可以自动调节汽车燃料进出，节约能源。作为前沿科技的自动驾驶汽车综合了人工智能很多方面的技术，越来越被人们所接受。通过特别许可，Google的自动驾驶汽车已经在完全无人控制的情况下，在加州的公路和街区中穿行了成千上万公里。美国佛罗里达州和加州已经通过立法允许自动驾驶汽车这种新型交通工具的使用，其他许多州也在积极讨论这一事宜。\r\n\r\n垃圾邮件杀手\r\n\r\n在如今的全世界的电子邮件中，每十封恐怕有九封都是垃圾邮件，如果这些垃圾邮件和正常邮件混在一起出现在你的收件夹里，恐怕没人再会用email了。能够把垃圾邮件从正常邮件中过滤出来的人工智能领域称为机器学习。正如名字里所说，垃圾邮件过滤器可以从环境中和从邮箱的主人怎样对待邮件中学习什么是好邮件和坏邮件。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n要判断什么样的邮件才算是垃圾邮件，只要看一下每天email的使用者打开邮箱之后，把哪些邮件加上星号保留，把哪些邮件看也不看就直接删掉，这些举动为垃圾邮件过滤器提供了最好的参考。电脑程序会根据这些信息把每个邮件分解成很多个“特征”，一个特征可以是单个词，也可以是一个词组，邮件发送的时间，或者邮件是由哪一台电脑发送过来的。这些特征可以帮助电脑程序决定一封邮件是正常邮件还是垃圾邮件。比如说，一封邮件里包括了“最低价格”、“精心包装”这两个特征词组，而根据全球统计，这两个词组在垃圾邮件中出现的比率高达8%和3%，而在正常邮件中，它们出现的比例只有0.1%和0.3%。之后在假设这些词语出现的几率是独立的前提下，通过数学上的贝叶斯定律公式和上面两项特征的统计数据，计算出这封邮件是垃圾邮件的概率有99.9%之高。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n垃圾邮件过滤器最重要的事情就是根据经验不断更新它使用的邮件判定模型。再好的垃圾邮件过滤器也会有犯错误的时候，可能放过坏邮件，也可能错杀好邮件，每当邮箱的主人把一封垃圾邮件箱里的邮件移回收件夹里或者在收件夹里点一下删除的时候，垃圾邮件过滤器会立刻更正自己的参数，做出新的改进，以提高识别邮件的准确率。对于编写垃圾邮件过滤器的程序员来说，他们并不需要一步一步地制定出繁琐的邮件判别标准，只需要构建一个人工智能系统，然后通过例子和真正的email来训练这套系统，让垃圾邮件过滤AI程序自己提高自己。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n万能翻译\r\n\r\n在任何一天，Google翻译功能所翻译的文字量比全世界所有专业翻译人员每年翻译量的总合还要大。Google翻译可以在65种语言之间任意两种之间进行翻译，一共有超过4000种翻译方式。Google翻译能够运行，一定离不开人工智能的一个领域——概率推理。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n在很多年前，语言学家通过双语字典上大量的词汇和一条条的语法规则来构建自动的翻译系统。但是这样做却失败了，如此的翻译会很生硬、很不灵活。比如法语语法规则里一般形容词在名词后面，英语语法规则里一般形容词在名词前面，可是也有例外的时候，比如“the light fantastic”。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n在过去二三十年里，自动翻译依靠的不再是语言学家制定的规则，而是从现实的例子中自动学习而来的由概率支配的规则，就好像以往是通过背单词和记语法来学外语，而现在是通过身临语言环境中学习。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n自动翻译另外一个重要方面是电脑和真人之间的配合和交互，很多自动翻译系统都是先在互联网上搜集大量真人翻译过的文件作为基础。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n当然自动翻译还远远称不上完美，但是它正在逐渐改进，准确度越来越高，语言的种类也越来越多。Google正在研究一个名为Translate的Android手机小程序，每当你对手机说一句话时，这个小程序可以把你所说的话转换成任意一种语言，发送给和你通电话的人，而对方在手机上也可以说自己的语言。随着自动翻译技术的发展，一个被长久期盼的诱人目标将有机会实现——每个人不需要学习任何外语，就可以和世界各地的朋友进行交流。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n人工智能的新未来\r\n\r\n在过去半个世纪中，几个关键的发展推动着人工智能科技出现在我们的身边。如今，科学家们对于神经科学和认知科学的新认识可以让我们设计出更新的硬件和软件。互联网的发展也使得直接访问全球的海量数据变得可能。不仅如此，人工智能或许还可以自己依靠自己来进化。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n进化\r\n\r\n现今大多数的人工智能系统如果完全依靠手动来编写程序，会变得很复杂，一个另辟蹊径的方法是让电脑程序自己进化自己。在虚拟的环境中，程序通过不断的迭代，尝试变化各种参数，在不断尝试和失败之中，程序逐渐“自然而然”变成设计者期望的样子。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n首先设计者们对于程序所在的环境进行模拟，就像一个游泳池或者一片沙漠一样，比如对于垃圾邮件过滤器，“环境”就是大量的邮件，既包括正常邮件也包括垃圾邮件。然后一个人工智能AI程序的不同版本会同时在模拟的环境中进行测试，这些AI程序会给出各自不同的输出结果，输出结果的质量会被评分，分数比较好的AI程序会被进一步的修改，分数比较差的AI程序会被遗弃掉，修改后的程序有的可以进一步变得更好，有的则会不如以前，同样优胜劣汰，如此往复，最后原本几个普通程序可以自然进化成很好的人工智能系统。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n这个过程其实非常像自然界中所发生的“弱肉强食，适者生存”，而一个程序的某个参数被修改如同基因突变，两个程序还可以各取一部分交叉到一起产生一个新的程序，就如同动物交配产生后代一样，这种让电脑程序自己进化自己的方法被称为“遗传算法”。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n电脑也需要直觉\r\n\r\n人类永远不是绝对理性的，我们在做决定的时候会犯很多常见的错误，会很容易受无关细节的干扰。有的时候我们并没有经过事实判断，匆匆忙忙做出一个决定，也就是常说的“相信自己的直觉”。我们曾经觉着“冷静”的电脑不像人一样冲动，一定是件好事，可是最近的认知科学研究结果却发现事实并非如此。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n一个人先天具有两种相互配套的做决定的方式，一种是缓慢的、深思熟虑的但同时也是理性的，另一种是快速的，有爆发力的，可以把当前的情况迅速和以往的经验联系起来，一两秒钟中做出决定。第二种方式或许才是人类智能的关键。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n我们在进行深思熟虑的时候，理性必定要以耗费更多的时间和精力为代价。比如有一辆车正迎面撞向你驾驶的车，你需要立刻做出反应，或者鸣笛，或者刹车，或者转向，而不是经过复杂的计算决定哪种选择是最优的，估计等结果算出来事故已经发生了。这种快速反应在非紧急情况下也同样有使用的必要，比如你如果每天都在仔细思考到底穿深蓝色衣服还是浅蓝色衣服这样无关紧要的问题，会浪费大量的时间和精力，耽误重要的事情。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n那么人工智能中是不是也应该加入直觉的成分呢？事实上，很多现代的人工智能系统真的有两部分，一部分用于瞬时反应的情况，另外一部分用于需要更多理性分析的情况。一些机器人使用多层系统结构，最底层只做直接的反应，较高的层组织和抑制这些反应，去完成更复杂的目标。这种方式可以很有效，控制步行机器人在凹凸不平的地面上行走就是一个例子。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n另外一种类似的方式是在人工智能程序中加入一些“情感”，比如一个机器人如果反复尝试做一件事情，不断失败，一个表达“气馁”情感的电路就可以“激励”机器人寻找新的选择。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n让机器来模拟情感本身就是件很复杂的任务，人工智能的创始者之一Marvin Minsky曾经认为情感并不是人的大脑所做的一件事，而是包括了大脑的很多部分之间的相互作用，还有大脑和身体之间的相互作用。情感会驱使我们做出某些选择，如果电脑程序的某部分能够让程序变得好像被情感驱使了一样，电脑程序自然变得更像人类的智能。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n像大脑一样的机器\r\n\r\n既然我们的目标是制造一台具有人类智能的机器，为何不直接复制一下人的大脑呢？人类自己毕竟是智能的最好样本。在过去的二三十年，神经科学对于我们的大脑是怎样处理和储存信息产生了很多新的认识。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n人类的大脑是由100万亿个神经突触连接着1000亿个神经元组成的一个网络，这些神经突触和神经元会在每秒内改变10到100次状态。我们大脑的这种结构使得它非常善于完成在一张图片中识别出一个物体这样的任务。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n而一台超级计算机可以拥有100万亿字节的内存，拥有的晶体管电路的运算速度比人的大脑快1亿倍，这种结构使得计算机擅长于去快速完成明确定义、工作量大、要求精确的任务。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n这两种结构各有优缺点，不过完成很多模糊性任务的时候，人脑的结构更加占据优势，比如像识别人脸，我们并不需要进行精确计算的电路。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n相比于超级计算机，人的大脑也是一台很节能的机器，人的大脑进行各种计算的时候，大约只需要20瓦的功率，只相当于一个亮度很低的老式电灯泡。而一台进行类似计算的超级计算机所需要的能量将会是20万瓦。据统计，每天应对全球无数搜索请求，拥有很多超级计算机的Google公司每年用电可以达到23亿千瓦时（度），相当于20.7万户美国家庭一年的用电量，相当于41座帝国大厦一年用电量，一个表面上看起来并非传统重工业的公司却是个耗电大户。这使得很多研究人员尝试着模仿人的大脑制造出节能高效的电脑硬件。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n我们都知道，任何一台电脑里都需要有CPU，内存和硬盘，假设CPU是你，内存是桌子，硬盘是柜子，而程序则是那些你放在柜子里的各种书籍，文件，玩具等等，CPU负责运算和执行各个程序，硬盘储存着各个程序，如果你想看看书或者玩玩具，那得先把相应的东西从柜子里拿出来放到桌面上，然后你才可以在桌面上玩玩具或者写作业。桌子就相当于内存，是一个临时储存程序的地方。在电脑里，这三个部件缺一不可，可是在人的大脑里，我们并没有相应的这些部分，处理储存信息都是在一起同时进行的。按照传统计算机的结构，你玩完玩具想去看书，需要先把玩具从桌子放回柜子里，然后再从柜子里拿一本书拿到桌子上，完成很多个不同的任务需要一道道的工序，效率就会降低，可是大脑的结构允许你同时做很多件事情，不需要做完一件再做另外一件。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n如今很多研究人员在尝试着模仿人类大脑制造出新型的计算机：它们平行地而不是一件一件地完成任务，它们更加模拟化而不是数字化，它们虽然会慢一些但是消耗的能源也很少。"}, "commit"=>"Update Review", "department_id"=>"1", "id"=>"7"}

提起人工智能(Artificial Intelliegnce,AI)，很多人会首先想起斯皮尔伯格导演的曾获2002年奥斯卡奖的科幻电影AI，在电影里一对夫妇领养了一个机器人作为自己的孩子，这个机器人可以像人一样思考，具有喜怒哀乐，在它的身上发生了许许多多的故事。这样的科幻情景离现实又有多远呢？我们不妨先从人工智能的起源谈起。

 

人工智能一直是人们的追求

 

在历史上，我们一直觉着智能不只是人类所独有的，可以像人类一样进行推理和学习的机器是完全可能被制造出来的，然而事情却不像想的那样简单。

 

什么是人工智能？

在百科全书上，人工智能的定义是“有关可以智能地工作的机器的科学和工程”。不过一个令人纠结的问题是：到底什么是智能？即便那些“不智能”的机器在很多时候已经比我们聪明了，比如普通的计算机程序可以将成千上万个数字相乘，可以记录下银行大量余额款项，这已经超出了普通人的能力，可是他们只是能够大量重复做同一件事情，而且给出了正确的结果而已，还称不上真正的“智能”。只有某些人类特有的能力，像认出一张熟悉的脸，指挥繁忙时段的交通或者学会一件乐器，才有资格称得上“智能”。

 

为什么让一台机器做这些事情这么难？这是因为，一般程序员在给电脑编写程序之前知道他想让电脑做的任务是什么，可是在人工智能领域我们要求电脑做正确的事情，可同时又不是很清楚事情到底是什么。比如我们让电脑去识别人脸，可是我们人类自己也不是完全清楚大脑在识别人脸的时候到底是怎么样工作的。

 

在现实世界中，我们要面对种种不确定性，比如你在做一件事情的时候，一个竞争对手突然出现，阻止你达到目标；你在驾车的时候，有时会转动方向盘改变车的方向，避免撞上其他的车，但是这样做是不是一定安全，只有天知道；或者在正在完成一项任务的过程中，突然来了一条新消息，需要随机应变。一个人工智能的电脑程序不能仅仅按照既定的计划完成任务，需要处理类似上面这样的所有不确定性的情形。

 

为了模拟人类的智能，电脑程序不仅要模拟完成的任务本身，还要为这个任务所处的世界建立模型。他必须感知到周围环境的变化，并且做出反应，相应的改变和调整自己的行动。只有一台机器可以在不确定的条件下做出正确的决定，才称得上智能。

 

哲学起源

人工智能的概念在世界上第一台电脑出现之前的很多个世纪就已经初具端倪，亚里士多德提出的从假设得出结论的“三段论”就是一种机械式的逻辑推理方法，。按照他的理论，我们可以这样进行论述：

前提：一些天鹅是白的；所有天鹅都是鸟

结论：有一些鸟是白的。

如果用符号来表示：

前提：一些S是W，所有的S都是B

结论：有一些B是W。

无论S，W，B代表什么，也就是说无论这句话中的词语具体是什么，我们都可以得到正确的结论。根据这样的构想，我们在没有完全知道人是怎么想问题的情况下，或许就可以建立出一套智能化的工作机制。

 

亚里斯多德的构想为探寻人工智能的本质奠定了基础。然而直到二十世纪中期，电脑才变得足够复杂，能够去真正测试一下这些构想。1948年英国布里斯托尔大学的研究人员Grey Walter制造了一些可以移动，可以感光，可以学习的机器乌龟。其中有一个叫Elsie的机器乌龟可以自动地对环境做出反应，比如当电池电量快耗尽的时候它就会自动地降低对光线的敏感度。这些复杂的行为使得这只机械乌龟看起来不仅仅是个机器人，而是像自然界的动物一样，会做出我们预料不到的举动。

 

在1950年，天才图灵提出，如果电脑和一个人可以谈话自如，我们应该“礼貌地”接受电脑可以思考的现实。

 

不过直到1956年，人工智能这个词语才正式被提出。在美国达特茅斯学院的一个暑期工作坊上，这个领域的早期创始者们共同提出了他们的愿景：如果学习的各种方式和智能各个侧面都可以从理论上进行精确描述，这样一台机器就可以模拟人的一切。按照这样的目标快速发展，似乎拥有真人一般智能的机器早晚会出现。

 

**化整为零**

 

在二十世纪六十年代的时候，人工智能研究人员满怀梦想，信心十足，觉着他们将会在几十年的时间内实现他们的目标，就像在航天领域从第一架喷气式飞机到人类登上月球也只用了30年。为什么人工智能不可以拥有这样火箭般的发展速度呢？

 

不过两者之间最大的不同之处在于，对于人工智能，我们找不到像F=ma和E=mc^2那样既简洁又决定一切的公式。到了八十年代，研究者意识到他们既没有足够硬件也没有足够的知识来模拟人可以做的所有事情，于是整个领域分成了很多个部分。以往研究者的共同的目标是制造一台拥有人类智慧的电脑，取而代之的是，研究者侧重于去研究这个宏大问题的某个侧面，比如语音识别，计算机视觉，概率推理-甚至仅仅是国际象棋这个小领域。

 

在每个领域内，研究者都取得了可喜的进步。在1997年，IBM“更深的蓝”电脑击败了国际象棋冠军卡斯帕罗夫。“更深的蓝”电脑在决定下一步怎么走棋的时候，在一秒的时间内就可以计算出两亿种不同的可能性。这使得电脑棋手可以在下一步棋之前事先推算出之后很多很多步棋可能出现的各种情况，来决定哪种局面是对自己最有利的。

 

“更深的蓝”电脑可以在一项需要高度智能的游戏中取得引人瞩目的胜利，然而，这位“专家”的技能有点太单一了，除了赢得一场象棋比赛以外，它什么都不会做，既不能和别人讨论他在下棋的时候使用过的策略，也不能玩其他的游戏，它尽管赢了世界大师，但是没有人会把它错当作真人，它还仅仅是一台电脑。

 

 

 

人工智能的时间线：

1950年 图灵提出，经过编程的电子计算机可以像真人一样回答问题

1956年 在美国达特茅斯学院的一个暑期工作坊上，这个领域的早期创始者们正式提出了“人工智能”这个词汇

1958年 Allen Newell和Herbert Simon预测在十年内，电脑可以击败国际象棋世界冠军，不过在现实中这整整花了四十年。

1961年，电脑解决了大学一年级程度的微积分题目

1965年，世界上第一个用于心理治疗的聊天机器人ELIZA，尝试着和人进行对话

1967年，STUDENT程序成功地解决了用文字描述的一道大学程度的代数题目

2011年，苹果的语音识别软件Siri可以让用户和iPhone对话；iRobot公司出售出了第600万个Roomba吸尘器机器人

2012年，Google翻译做的翻译总量已经超过了所有人类翻译者所做的总合

2012年，通过10亿个连接，Google的人工智能神经网络可以去识别一些常见的物体，像人脸和猫

 

 

日常生活中的AI

你或许没有意识到，其实你每天都在和AI人工智能打交道，它们在帮你选择手机通话线路，在审核你的信用卡交易，在过滤掉诈骗垃圾e-mail和自动管理你的基金进行股票交易。它们还可以在你的数码照片中识别出你的脸，或者你在玩视频游戏的时候识别你的手势，甚至可以帮助你的医生分析化验结果，这些常见的电脑程序其实都拥有真人一样的智能。

 

数据挖掘者

2011年，IBM公司向世界推出了Watson，一个可以理解用日常语言提出的问题，并且可以准确地给出答案的超级计算机。Watson拥有3000个联网在一起的处理器，每个处理器可以看作是一台小型的电脑，它们一共储存着几百万份文件，Watson可以随时抽出其中的一份来帮助回答任何问题。

 

IBM选择了在美国一个电视问答娱乐节目Jeopardy上让Watson这个计算巨人首次登场亮相，Jeopardy节目一向以提出“拐弯抹角”的问题而出名，有点像国内的开心辞典和幸运52。这个游戏可比国际象棋复杂的多，Watson不仅需要综合所有人类知识，还需要理解节目问题中的各种文字游戏。

 

在Watson在节目舞台上精彩表现的背后，人工智能的一个分支概率推理功不可没：这种推理可以在不完整的信息组合中提取出一幅完成的画面。在比赛开始前，大量的维基百科文字，网页和其他参考资料，以及以往Jeopardy节目的资料都被塞进了Watson的硬盘里。然后IBM的工程师们把Watson的电脑程序分成了100个小程序，每个小程序负责一个方面，比如一个程序会专门负责“著名作家”，另一个程序负责“食品”。当这些“各个领域的专家”搜索完了各自的数据库之后，Watson会综合这100个分程序的结果，选择出最有可能正确的答案。Watson曾经在电视节目中击败两位真人的冠军。

 

不过成为Jeopardy比赛的冠军并不是Watson的真正使命，IBM计划利用Watson完成一些更加严肃的任务，比如给医学、商业、农业这些领域提供时效性很强的关键信息。

 

行驶在公路上的AI

在通往拉斯维加斯的公路上，如果你看到一辆汽车上面有红色的车牌和无穷大符号，就要留意一下了，这可能是一辆无人驾驶的汽车。内华达州为无人驾驶汽车发放了第一张牌照。

 

在世界上其他地方，无人驾驶汽车也会火起来吗？应该说，到现在为止，驾驶还是一项仍旧由真人司机占据主导地位的任务，因为驾车虽然称不上很难，但其中有太多变量，比如正在接近你的车是以60公里每小时还是70公里每小时行驶？在角落里会不会还有一辆在你的视角之外的车？如果我想超过前面的车，前面车的司机会不会突然超速？诸如此类的问题还会有很多。

 

对于人工智能来说，在公路上无人驾驶汽车还不算是最难的任务，早在1994年，两辆无人驾驶汽车就曾经在环绕巴黎的公路上行驶了1000公里。但是如果让无人驾驶汽车在城市中穿行，任务一下子就变得困难很多，城市交通中很多不成文的规则会让AI汽车摸不到头脑。比如说，如果Google的研究者严格按照司机守则为AI汽车编写程序，在十字路口上一定要为其他汽车让路，他们会发现这台太过老实的无人驾驶汽车永远也没法走过这个路口。于是，他们对程序做了一点改进，当AI汽车等待了一段时间之后，就会自动缓慢向前移动，向其他汽车示意自己想要先走，而不只是傻傻地等待。

 

对于自动驾驶汽车还有一个不确定性是如何判断自己所处的位置，GPS卫星定位数据有时并不靠谱，误差会达到几米之多，AI汽车在使用GPS的同时，还会同时开启照相机、雷达和激光定位功能，共同帮助校正GPS的数据，不要让汽车越走越偏。这几项定位功能每一项都有自己的优缺点，都不是完全准确的，但是综合到一起就可以达到很高的精确度。

 

除了直接驾驶汽车以外，AI还可以自动调节汽车燃料进出，节约能源。作为前沿科技的自动驾驶汽车综合了人工智能很多方面的技术，越来越被人们所接受。通过特别许可，Google的自动驾驶汽车已经在完全无人控制的情况下，在加州的公路和街区中穿行了成千上万公里。美国佛罗里达州和加州已经通过立法允许自动驾驶汽车这种新型交通工具的使用，其他许多州也在积极讨论这一事宜。

垃圾邮件杀手

在如今的全世界的电子邮件中，每十封恐怕有九封都是垃圾邮件，如果这些垃圾邮件和正常邮件混在一起出现在你的收件夹里，恐怕没人再会用email了。能够把垃圾邮件从正常邮件中过滤出来的人工智能领域称为机器学习。正如名字里所说，垃圾邮件过滤器可以从环境中和从邮箱的主人怎样对待邮件中学习什么是好邮件和坏邮件。

 

要判断什么样的邮件才算是垃圾邮件，只要看一下每天email的使用者打开邮箱之后，把哪些邮件加上星号保留，把哪些邮件看也不看就直接删掉，这些举动为垃圾邮件过滤器提供了最好的参考。电脑程序会根据这些信息把每个邮件分解成很多个“特征”，一个特征可以是单个词，也可以是一个词组，邮件发送的时间，或者邮件是由哪一台电脑发送过来的。这些特征可以帮助电脑程序决定一封邮件是正常邮件还是垃圾邮件。比如说，一封邮件里包括了“最低价格”、“精心包装”这两个特征词组，而根据全球统计，这两个词组在垃圾邮件中出现的比率高达8%和3%，而在正常邮件中，它们出现的比例只有0.1%和0.3%。之后在假设这些词语出现的几率是独立的前提下，通过数学上的贝叶斯定律公式和上面两项特征的统计数据，计算出这封邮件是垃圾邮件的概率有99.9%之高。

 

垃圾邮件过滤器最重要的事情就是根据经验不断更新它使用的邮件判定模型。再好的垃圾邮件过滤器也会有犯错误的时候，可能放过坏邮件，也可能错杀好邮件，每当邮箱的主人把一封垃圾邮件箱里的邮件移回收件夹里或者在收件夹里点一下删除的时候，垃圾邮件过滤器会立刻更正自己的参数，做出新的改进，以提高识别邮件的准确率。对于编写垃圾邮件过滤器的程序员来说，他们并不需要一步一步地制定出繁琐的邮件判别标准，只需要构建一个人工智能系统，然后通过例子和真正的email来训练这套系统，让垃圾邮件过滤AI程序自己提高自己。

在过去二三十年里，自动翻译依靠的不再是语言学家制定的规则，而是从现实的例子中自动学习而来的由概率支配的规则，就好像以往是通过背单词和记语法来学外语，而现在是通过身临语言环境中学习。

 

自动翻译另外一个重要方面是电脑和真人之间的配合和交互，很多自动翻译系统都是先在互联网上搜集大量真人翻译过的文件作为基础。

 

当然自动翻译还远远称不上完美，但是它正在逐渐改进，准确度越来越高，语言的种类也越来越多。Google正在研究一个名为Translate的Android手机小程序，每当你对手机说一句话时，这个小程序可以把你所说的话转换成任意一种语言，发送给和你通电话的人，而对方在手机上也可以说自己的语言。随着自动翻译技术的发展，一个被长久期盼的诱人目标将有机会实现——每个人不需要学习任何外语，就可以和世界各地的朋友进行交流。

 

人工智能的新未来

在过去半个世纪中，几个关键的发展推动着人工智能科技出现在我们的身边。如今，科学家们对于神经科学和认知科学的新认识可以让我们设计出更新的硬件和软件。互联网的发展也使得直接访问全球的海量数据变得可能。不仅如此，人工智能或许还可以自己依靠自己来进化。

 

进化

现今大多数的人工智能系统如果完全依靠手动来编写程序，会变得很复杂，一个另辟蹊径的方法是让电脑程序自己进化自己。在虚拟的环境中，程序通过不断的迭代，尝试变化各种参数，在不断尝试和失败之中，程序逐渐“自然而然”变成设计者期望的样子。

 

首先设计者们对于程序所在的环境进行模拟，就像一个游泳池或者一片沙漠一样，比如对于垃圾邮件过滤器，“环境”就是大量的邮件，既包括正常邮件也包括垃圾邮件。然后一个人工智能AI程序的不同版本会同时在模拟的环境中进行测试，这些AI程序会给出各自不同的输出结果，输出结果的质量会被评分，分数比较好的AI程序会被进一步的修改，分数比较差的AI程序会被遗弃掉，修改后的程序有的可以进一步变得更好，有的则会不如以前，同样优胜劣汰，如此往复，最后原本几个普通程序可以自然进化成很好的人工智能系统。

 

这个过程其实非常像自然界中所发生的“弱肉强食，适者生存”，而一个程序的某个参数被修改如同基因突变，两个程序还可以各取一部分交叉到一起产生一个新的程序，就如同动物交配产生后代一样，这种让电脑程序自己进化自己的方法被称为“遗传算法”。

 

电脑也需要直觉

人类永远不是绝对理性的，我们在做决定的时候会犯很多常见的错误，会很容易受无关细节的干扰。有的时候我们并没有经过事实判断，匆匆忙忙做出一个决定，也就是常说的“相信自己的直觉”。我们曾经觉着“冷静”的电脑不像人一样冲动，一定是件好事，可是最近的认知科学研究结果却发现事实并非如此。

 

一个人先天具有两种相互配套的做决定的方式，一种是缓慢的、深思熟虑的但同时也是理性的，另一种是快速的，有爆发力的，可以把当前的情况迅速和以往的经验联系起来，一两秒钟中做出决定。第二种方式或许才是人类智能的关键。

 

我们在进行深思熟虑的时候，理性必定要以耗费更多的时间和精力为代价。比如有一辆车正迎面撞向你驾驶的车，你需要立刻做出反应，或者鸣笛，或者刹车，或者转向，而不是经过复杂的计算决定哪种选择是最优的，估计等结果算出来事故已经发生了。这种快速反应在非紧急情况下也同样有使用的必要，比如你如果每天都在仔细思考到底穿深蓝色衣服还是浅蓝色衣服这样无关紧要的问题，会浪费大量的时间和精力，耽误重要的事情。

 

那么人工智能中是不是也应该加入直觉的成分呢？事实上，很多现代的人工智能系统真的有两部分，一部分用于瞬时反应的情况，另外一部分用于需要更多理性分析的情况。一些机器人使用多层系统结构，最底层只做直接的反应，较高的层组织和抑制这些反应，去完成更复杂的目标。这种方式可以很有效，控制步行机器人在凹凸不平的地面上行走就是一个例子。

 

另外一种类似的方式是在人工智能程序中加入一些“情感”，比如一个机器人如果反复尝试做一件事情，不断失败，一个表达“气馁”情感的电路就可以“激励”机器人寻找新的选择。

 

让机器来模拟情感本身就是件很复杂的任务，人工智能的创始者之一Marvin Minsky曾经认为情感并不是人的大脑所做的一件事，而是包括了大脑的很多部分之间的相互作用，还有大脑和身体之间的相互作用。情感会驱使我们做出某些选择，如果电脑程序的某部分能够让程序变得好像被情感驱使了一样，电脑程序自然变得更像人类的智能。

 

像大脑一样的机器

既然我们的目标是制造一台具有人类智能的机器，为何不直接复制一下人的大脑呢？人类自己毕竟是智能的最好样本。在过去的二三十年，神经科学对于我们的大脑是怎样处理和储存信息产生了很多新的认识。

 

人类的大脑是由100万亿个神经突触连接着1000亿个神经元组成的一个网络，这些神经突触和神经元会在每秒内改变10到100次状态。我们大脑的这种结构使得它非常善于完成在一张图片中识别出一个物体这样的任务。

 

而一台超级计算机可以拥有100万亿字节的内存，拥有的晶体管电路的运算速度比人的大脑快1亿倍，这种结构使得计算机擅长于去快速完成明确定义、工作量大、要求精确的任务。

 

这两种结构各有优缺点，不过完成很多模糊性任务的时候，人脑的结构更加占据优势，比如像识别人脸，我们并不需要进行精确计算的电路。

 

相比于超级计算机，人的大脑也是一台很节能的机器，人的大脑进行各种计算的时候，大约只需要20瓦的功率，只相当于一个亮度很低的老式电灯泡。而一台进行类似计算的超级计算机所需要的能量将会是20万瓦。据统计，每天应对全球无数搜索请求，拥有很多超级计算机的Google公司每年用电可以达到23亿千瓦时（度），相当于20.7万户美国家庭一年的用电量，相当于41座帝国大厦一年用电量，一个表面上看起来并非传统重工业的公司却是个耗电大户。这使得很多研究人员尝试着模仿人的大脑制造出节能高效的电脑硬件。

 

我们都知道，任何一台电脑里都需要有CPU，内存和硬盘，假设CPU是你，内存是桌子，硬盘是柜子，而程序则是那些你放在柜子里的各种书籍，文件，玩具等等，CPU负责运算和执行各个程序，硬盘储存着各个程序，如果你想看看书或者玩玩具，那得先把相应的东西从柜子里拿出来放到桌面上，然后你才可以在桌面上玩玩具或者写作业。桌子就相当于内存，是一个临时储存程序的地方。在电脑里，这三个部件缺一不可，可是在人的大脑里，我们并没有相应的这些部分，处理储存信息都是在一起同时进行的。按照传统计算机的结构，你玩完玩具想去看书，需要先把玩具从桌子放回柜子里，然后再从柜子里拿一本书拿到桌子上，完成很多个不同的任务需要一道道的工序，效率就会降低，可是大脑的结构允许你同时做很多件事情，不需要做完一件再做另外一件。

 

如今很多研究人员在尝试着模仿人类大脑制造出新型的计算机：它们平行地而不是一件一件地完成任务，它们更加模拟化而不是数字化，它们虽然会慢一些但是消耗的能源也很少。', "updated_at" = '2013-06-28 16:11:57.712076' WHERE "reviews"."id" = 7[0m

"content"=>"让机器像人类一样思考——AI人工智能\r\n----------------------------\r\n \r\n\r\n*原文New Scientist杂志，翻译Albert JIAO* \r\n\r\n提起人工智能(Artificial Intelliegnce,AI)，很多人会首先想起斯皮尔伯格导演的曾获2002年奥斯卡奖的科幻电影AI，在电影里一对夫妇领养了一个机器人作为自己的孩子，这个机器人可以像人一样思考，具有喜怒哀乐，在它的身上发生了许许多多的故事。这样的科幻情景离现实又有多远呢？我们不妨先从人工智能的起源谈起。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n人工智能一直是人们的追求\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n在历史上，我们一直觉着智能不只是人类所独有的，可以像人类一样进行推理和学习的机器是完全可能被制造出来的，然而事情却不像想的那样简单。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n什么是人工智能？\r\n\r\n在百科全书上，人工智能的定义是“有关可以智能地工作的机器的科学和工程”。不过一个令人纠结的问题是：到底什么是智能？即便那些“不智能”的机器在很多时候已经比我们聪明了，比如普通的计算机程序可以将成千上万个数字相乘，可以记录下银行大量余额款项，这已经超出了普通人的能力，可是他们只是能够大量重复做同一件事情，而且给出了正确的结果而已，还称不上真正的“智能”。只有某些人类特有的能力，像认出一张熟悉的脸，指挥繁忙时段的交通或者学会一件乐器，才有资格称得上“智能”。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n为什么让一台机器做这些事情这么难？这是因为，一般程序员在给电脑编写程序之前知道他想让电脑做的任务是什么，可是在人工智能领域我们要求电脑做正确的事情，可同时又不是很清楚事情到底是什么。比如我们让电脑去识别人脸，可是我们人类自己也不是完全清楚大脑在识别人脸的时候到底是怎么样工作的。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n在现实世界中，我们要面对种种不确定性，比如你在做一件事情的时候，一个竞争对手突然出现，阻止你达到目标；你在驾车的时候，有时会转动方向盘改变车的方向，避免撞上其他的车，但是这样做是不是一定安全，只有天知道；或者在正在完成一项任务的过程中，突然来了一条新消息，需要随机应变。一个人工智能的电脑程序不能仅仅按照既定的计划完成任务，需要处理类似上面这样的所有不确定性的情形。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n为了模拟人类的智能，电脑程序不仅要模拟完成的任务本身，还要为这个任务所处的世界建立模型。他必须感知到周围环境的变化，并且做出反应，相应的改变和调整自己的行动。只有一台机器可以在不确定的条件下做出正确的决定，才称得上智能。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n哲学起源\r\n\r\n人工智能的概念在世界上第一台电脑出现之前的很多个世纪就已经初具端倪，亚里士多德提出的从假设得出结论的“三段论”就是一种机械式的逻辑推理方法，。按照他的理论，我们可以这样进行论述：\r\n\r\n前提：一些天鹅是白的；所有天鹅都是鸟\r\n\r\n结论：有一些鸟是白的。\r\n\r\n如果用符号来表示：\r\n\r\n前提：一些S是W，所有的S都是B\r\n\r\n结论：有一些B是W。\r\n\r\n无论S，W，B代表什么，也就是说无论这句话中的词语具体是什么，我们都可以得到正确的结论。根据这样的构想，我们在没有完全知道人是怎么想问题的情况下，或许就可以建立出一套智能化的工作机制。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n亚里斯多德的构想为探寻人工智能的本质奠定了基础。然而直到二十世纪中期，电脑才变得足够复杂，能够去真正测试一下这些构想。1948年英国布里斯托尔大学的研究人员Grey Walter制造了一些可以移动，可以感光，可以学习的机器乌龟。其中有一个叫Elsie的机器乌龟可以自动地对环境做出反应，比如当电池电量快耗尽的时候它就会自动地降低对光线的敏感度。这些复杂的行为使得这只机械乌龟看起来不仅仅是个机器人，而是像自然界的动物一样，会做出我们预料不到的举动。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n在1950年，天才图灵提出，如果电脑和一个人可以谈话自如，我们应该“礼貌地”接受电脑可以思考的现实。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n不过直到1956年，人工智能这个词语才正式被提出。在美国达特茅斯学院的一个暑期工作坊上，这个领域的早期创始者们共同提出了他们的愿景：如果学习的各种方式和智能各个侧面都可以从理论上进行精确描述，这样一台机器就可以模拟人的一切。按照这样的目标快速发展，似乎拥有真人一般智能的机器早晚会出现。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**化整为零**\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n在二十世纪六十年代的时候，人工智能研究人员满怀梦想，信心十足，觉着他们将会在几十年的时间内实现他们的目标，就像在航天领域从第一架喷气式飞机到人类登上月球也只用了30年。为什么人工智能不可以拥有这样火箭般的发展速度呢？\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n不过两者之间最大的不同之处在于，对于人工智能，我们找不到像F=ma和E=mc^2那样既简洁又决定一切的公式。到了八十年代，研究者意识到他们既没有足够硬件也没有足够的知识来模拟人可以做的所有事情，于是整个领域分成了很多个部分。以往研究者的共同的目标是制造一台拥有人类智慧的电脑，取而代之的是，研究者侧重于去研究这个宏大问题的某个侧面，比如语音识别，计算机视觉，概率推理-甚至仅仅是国际象棋这个小领域。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n在每个领域内，研究者都取得了可喜的进步。在1997年，IBM“更深的蓝”电脑击败了国际象棋冠军卡斯帕罗夫。“更深的蓝”电脑在决定下一步怎么走棋的时候，在一秒的时间内就可以计算出两亿种不同的可能性。这使得电脑棋手可以在下一步棋之前事先推算出之后很多很多步棋可能出现的各种情况，来决定哪种局面是对自己最有利的。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“更深的蓝”电脑可以在一项需要高度智能的游戏中取得引人瞩目的胜利，然而，这位“专家”的技能有点太单一了，除了赢得一场象棋比赛以外，它什么都不会做，既不能和别人讨论他在下棋的时候使用过的策略，也不能玩其他的游戏，它尽管赢了世界大师，但是没有人会把它错当作真人，它还仅仅是一台电脑。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n![Alt

在美国达特茅斯学院的一个暑期工作坊上，这个领域的早期创始者们正式提出了“人工智能”这个词汇\r\n\r\n1958年 Allen Newell和Herbert Simon预测在十年内，电脑可以击败国际象棋世界冠军，不过在现实中这整整花了四十年。\r\n\r\n1961年，电脑解决了大学一年级程度的微积分题目\r\n\r\n1965年，世界上第一个用于心理治疗的聊天机器人ELIZA，尝试着和人进行对话\r\n\r\n1967年，STUDENT程序成功地解决了用文字描述的一道大学程度的代数题目\r\n\r\n1973年，Freddy机器人通过视觉感知来定位和组装了模型\r\n\r\n1974年，随着政府资助机构减少了对于人工智能研究的拨款预算，人工智能寒冬到来\r\n\r\n1975年，斯坦福大学的Meta-DENDRAL程序发现关于分子的新规律，成果被发表在了美国化学学会的期刊上\r\n\r\n1980年，自动行驶的汽车在慕尼黑大学里以90公里/小时的速度行驶\r\n\r\n1988年，人工智能的主要形式变为基于不确定数据的概率推理，而不再是以往那样侧重于逻辑\r\n\r\n1989年，美国航天局（NASA）利用自动聚类的电脑程序发现以往未知的几类恒星\r\n\r\n1997年，IBM“更深的蓝”超级电脑击败了国际象棋冠军卡斯帕罗夫\r\n\r\n1998年，由Hasbro生产的第一个人工智能的宠物Furby开始在美国出售；美国航天局（NASA）第一次有了完全由电脑程序自动控制的飞行器\r\n\r\n2000年，Nomad机器人探索南极洲的偏远地区，采集气象观测样本\r\n\r\n2004年，一个电脑程序可以比一个专业级真人飞行员更快地学会操纵遥控直升机\r\n\r\n2007年，美国艾尔伯特大学的人工智能程序完全破解了西洋跳棋游戏\r\n\r\n2011年，苹果的语音识别软件Siri可以让用户和iPhone对话；iRobot公司出售出了第600万个Roomba吸尘器机器人\r\n\r\n2012年，Google翻译做的翻译总量已经超过了所有人类翻译者所做的总合\r\n\r\n2012年，通过10亿个连接，Google的人工智能神经网络可以去识别一些常见的物体，像人脸和猫\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n日常生活中的AI\r\n\r\n你或许没有意识到，其实你每天都在和AI人工智能打交道，它们在帮你选择手机通话线路，在审核你的信用卡交易，在过滤掉诈骗垃圾e-mail和自动管理你的基金进行股票交易。它们还可以在你的数码照片中识别出你的脸，或者你在玩视频游戏的时候识别你的手势，甚至可以帮助你的医生分析化验结果，这些常见的电脑程序其实都拥有真人一样的智能。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n数据挖掘者\r\n\r\n2011年，IBM公司向世界推出了Watson，一个可以理解用日常语言提出的问题，并且可以准确地给出答案的超级计算机。Watson拥有3000个联网在一起的处理器，每个处理器可以看作是一台小型的电脑，它们一共储存着几百万份文件，Watson可以随时抽出其中的一份来帮助回答任何问题。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIBM选择了在美国一个电视问答娱乐节目Jeopardy上让Watson这个计算巨人首次登场亮相，Jeopardy节目一向以提出“拐弯抹角”的问题而出名，有点像国内的开心辞典和幸运52。这个游戏可比国际象棋复杂的多，Watson不仅需要综合所有人类知识，还需要理解节目问题中的各种文字游戏。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n在Watson在节目舞台上精彩表现的背后，人工智能的一个分支概率推理功不可没：这种推理可以在不完整的信息组合中提取出一幅完成的画面。在比赛开始前，大量的维基百科文字，网页和其他参考资料，以及以往Jeopardy节目的资料都被塞进了Watson的硬盘里。然后IBM的工程师们把Watson的电脑程序分成了100个小程序，每个小程序负责一个方面，比如一个程序会专门负责“著名作家”，另一个程序负责“食品”。当这些“各个领域的专家”搜索完了各自的数据库之后，Watson会综合这100个分程序的结果，选择出最有可能正确的答案。Watson曾经在电视节目中击败两位真人的冠军。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n不过成为Jeopardy比赛的冠军并不是Watson的真正使命，IBM计划利用Watson完成一些更加严肃的任务，比如给医学、商业、农业这些领域提供时效性很强的关键信息。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n行驶在公路上的AI\r\n\r\n在通往拉斯维加斯的公路上，如果你看到一辆汽车上面有红色的车牌和无穷大符号，就要留意一下了，这可能是一辆无人驾驶的汽车。内华达州为无人驾驶汽车发放了第一张牌照。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n在世界上其他地方，无人驾驶汽车也会火起来吗？应该说，到现在为止，驾驶还是一项仍旧由真人司机占据主导地位的任务，因为驾车虽然称不上很难，但其中有太多变量，比如正在接近你的车是以60公里每小时还是70公里每小时行驶？在角落里会不会还有一辆在你的视角之外的车？如果我想超过前面的车，前面车的司机会不会突然超速？诸如此类的问题还会有很多。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n对于人工智能来说，在公路上无人驾驶汽车还不算是最难的任务，早在1994年，两辆无人驾驶汽车就曾经在环绕巴黎的公路上行驶了1000公里。但是如果让无人驾驶汽车在城市中穿行，任务一下子就变得困难很多，城市交通中很多不成文的规则会让AI汽车摸不到头脑。比如说，如果Google的研究者严格按照司机守则为AI汽车编写程序，在十字路口上一定要为其他汽车让路，他们会发现这台太过老实的无人驾驶汽车永远也没法走过这个路口。于是，他们对程序做了一点改进，当AI汽车等待了一段时间之后，就会自动缓慢向前移动，向其他汽车示意自己想要先走，而不只是傻傻地等待。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n对于自动驾驶汽车还有一个不确定性是如何判断自己所处的位置，GPS卫星定位数据有时并不靠谱，误差会达到几米之多，AI汽车在使用GPS的同时，还会同时开启照相机、雷达和激光定位功能，共同帮助校正GPS的数据，不要让汽车越走越偏。这几项定位功能每一项都有自己的优缺点，都不是完全准确的，但是综合到一起就可以达到很高的精确度。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n除了直接驾驶汽车以外，AI还可以自动调节汽车燃料进出，节约能源。作为前沿科技的自动驾驶汽车综合了人工智能很多方面的技术，越来越被人们所接受。通过特别许可，Google的自动驾驶汽车已经在完全无人控制的情况下，在加州的公路和街区中穿行了成千上万公里。美国佛罗里达州和加州已经通过立法允许自动驾驶汽车这种新型交通工具的使用，其他许多州也在积极讨论这一事宜。\r\n\r\n垃圾邮件杀手\r\n\r\n在如今的全世界的电子邮件中，每十封恐怕有九封都是垃圾邮件，如果这些垃圾邮件和正常邮件混在一起出现在你的收件夹里，恐怕没人再会用email了。能够把垃圾邮件从正常邮件中过滤出来的人工智能领域称为机器学习。正如名字里所说，垃圾邮件过滤器可以从环境中和从邮箱的主人怎样对待邮件中学习什么是好邮件和坏邮件。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n要判断什么样的邮件才算是垃圾邮件，只要看一下每天email的使用者打开邮箱之后，把哪些邮件加上星号保留，把哪些邮件看也不看就直接删掉，这些举动为垃圾邮件过滤器提供了最好的参考。电脑程序会根据这些信息把每个邮件分解成很多个“特征”，一个特征可以是单个词，也可以是一个词组，邮件发送的时间，或者邮件是由哪一台电脑发送过来的。这些特征可以帮助电脑程序决定一封邮件是正常邮件还是垃圾邮件。比如说，一封邮件里包括了“最低价格”、“精心包装”这两个特征词组，而根据全球统计，这两个词组在垃圾邮件中出现的比率高达8%和3%，而在正常邮件中，它们出现的比例只有0.1%和0.3%。之后在假设这些词语出现的几率是独立的前提下，通过数学上的贝叶斯定律公式和上面两项特征的统计数据，计算出这封邮件是垃圾邮件的概率有99.9%之高。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n垃圾邮件过滤器最重要的事情就是根据经验不断更新它使用的邮件判定模型。再好的垃圾邮件过滤器也会有犯错误的时候，可能放过坏邮件，也可能错杀好邮件，每当邮箱的主人把一封垃圾邮件箱里的邮件移回收件夹里或者在收件夹里点一下删除的时候，垃圾邮件过滤器会立刻更正自己的参数，做出新的改进，以提高识别邮件的准确率。对于编写垃圾邮件过滤器的程序员来说，他们并不需要一步一步地制定出繁琐的邮件判别标准，只需要构建一个人工智能系统，然后通过例子和真正的email来训练这套系统，让垃圾邮件过滤AI程序自己提高自己。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n万能翻译\r\n\r\n在任何一天，Google翻译功能所翻译的文字量比全世界所有专业翻译人员每年翻译量的总合还要大。Google翻译可以在65种语言之间任意两种之间进行翻译，一共有超过4000种翻译方式。Google翻译能够运行，一定离不开人工智能的一个领域——概率推理。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n在很多年前，语言学家通过双语字典上大量的词汇和一条条的语法规则来构建自动的翻译系统。但是这样做却失败了，如此的翻译会很生硬、很不灵活。比如法语语法规则里一般形容词在名词后面，英语语法规则里一般形容词在名词前面，可是也有例外的时候，比如“the light fantastic”。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n在过去二三十年里，自动翻译依靠的不再是语言学家制定的规则，而是从现实的例子中自动学习而来的由概率支配的规则，就好像以往是通过背单词和记语法来学外语，而现在是通过身临语言环境中学习。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n自动翻译另外一个重要方面是电脑和真人之间的配合和交互，很多自动翻译系统都是先在互联网上搜集大量真人翻译过的文件作为基础。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n当然自动翻译还远远称不上完美，但是它正在逐渐改进，准确度越来越高，语言的种类也越来越多。Google正在研究一个名为Translate的Android手机小程序，每当你对手机说一句话时，这个小程序可以把你所说的话转换成任意一种语言，发送给和你通电话的人，而对方在手机上也可以说自己的语言。随着自动翻译技术的发展，一个被长久期盼的诱人目标将有机会实现——每个人不需要学习任何外语，就可以和世界各地的朋友进行交流。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n人工智能的新未来\r\n\r\n在过去半个世纪中，几个关键的发展推动着人工智能科技出现在我们的身边。如今，科学家们对于神经科学和认知科学的新认识可以让我们设计出更新的硬件和软件。互联网的发展也使得直接访问全球的海量数据变得可能。不仅如此，人工智能或许还可以自己依靠自己来进化。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n进化\r\n\r\n现今大多数的人工智能系统如果完全依靠手动来编写程序，会变得很复杂，一个另辟蹊径的方法是让电脑程序自己进化自己。在虚拟的环境中，程序通过不断的迭代，尝试变化各种参数，在不断尝试和失败之中，程序逐渐“自然而然”变成设计者期望的样子。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n首先设计者们对于程序所在的环境进行模拟，就像一个游泳池或者一片沙漠一样，比如对于垃圾邮件过滤器，“环境”就是大量的邮件，既包括正常邮件也包括垃圾邮件。然后一个人工智能AI程序的不同版本会同时在模拟的环境中进行测试，这些AI程序会给出各自不同的输出结果，输出结果的质量会被评分，分数比较好的AI程序会被进一步的修改，分数比较差的AI程序会被遗弃掉，修改后的程序有的可以进一步变得更好，有的则会不如以前，同样优胜劣汰，如此往复，最后原本几个普通程序可以自然进化成很好的人工智能系统。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n这个过程其实非常像自然界中所发生的“弱肉强食，适者生存”，而一个程序的某个参数被修改如同基因突变，两个程序还可以各取一部分交叉到一起产生一个新的程序，就如同动物交配产生后代一样，这种让电脑程序自己进化自己的方法被称为“遗传算法”。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n电脑也需要直觉\r\n\r\n人类永远不是绝对理性的，我们在做决定的时候会犯很多常见的错误，会很容易受无关细节的干扰。有的时候我们并没有经过事实判断，匆匆忙忙做出一个决定，也就是常说的“相信自己的直觉”。我们曾经觉着“冷静”的电脑不像人一样冲动，一定是件好事，可是最近的认知科学研究结果却发现事实并非如此。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n一个人先天具有两种相互配套的做决定的方式，一种是缓慢的、深思熟虑的但同时也是理性的，另一种是快速的，有爆发力的，可以把当前的情况迅速和以往的经验联系起来，一两秒钟中做出决定。第二种方式或许才是人类智能的关键。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n我们在进行深思熟虑的时候，理性必定要以耗费更多的时间和精力为代价。比如有一辆车正迎面撞向你驾驶的车，你需要立刻做出反应，或者鸣笛，或者刹车，或者转向，而不是经过复杂的计算决定哪种选择是最优的，估计等结果算出来事故已经发生了。这种快速反应在非紧急情况下也同样有使用的必要，比如你如果每天都在仔细思考到底穿深蓝色衣服还是浅蓝色衣服这样无关紧要的问题，会浪费大量的时间和精力，耽误重要的事情。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n那么人工智能中是不是也应该加入直觉的成分呢？事实上，很多现代的人工智能系统真的有两部分，一部分用于瞬时反应的情况，另外一部分用于需要更多理性分析的情况。一些机器人使用多层系统结构，最底层只做直接的反应，较高的层组织和抑制这些反应，去完成更复杂的目标。这种方式可以很有效，控制步行机器人在凹凸不平的地面上行走就是一个例子。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n另外一种类似的方式是在人工智能程序中加入一些“情感”，比如一个机器人如果反复尝试做一件事情，不断失败，一个表达“气馁”情感的电路就可以“激励”机器人寻找新的选择。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n让机器来模拟情感本身就是件很复杂的任务，人工智能的创始者之一Marvin Minsky曾经认为情感并不是人的大脑所做的一件事，而是包括了大脑的很多部分之间的相互作用，还有大脑和身体之间的相互作用。情感会驱使我们做出某些选择，如果电脑程序的某部分能够让程序变得好像被情感驱使了一样，电脑程序自然变得更像人类的智能。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n像大脑一样的机器\r\n\r\n既然我们的目标是制造一台具有人类智能的机器，为何不直接复制一下人的大脑呢？人类自己毕竟是智能的最好样本。在过去的二三十年，神经科学对于我们的大脑是怎样处理和储存信息产生了很多新的认识。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n人类的大脑是由100万亿个神经突触连接着1000亿个神经元组成的一个网络，这些神经突触和神经元会在每秒内改变10到100次状态。我们大脑的这种结构使得它非常善于完成在一张图片中识别出一个物体这样的任务。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n而一台超级计算机可以拥有100万亿字节的内存，拥有的晶体管电路的运算速度比人的大脑快1亿倍，这种结构使得计算机擅长于去快速完成明确定义、工作量大、要求精确的任务。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n这两种结构各有优缺点，不过完成很多模糊性任务的时候，人脑的结构更加占据优势，比如像识别人脸，我们并不需要进行精确计算的电路。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n相比于超级计算机，人的大脑也是一台很节能的机器，人的大脑进行各种计算的时候，大约只需要20瓦的功率，只相当于一个亮度很低的老式电灯泡。而一台进行类似计算的超级计算机所需要的能量将会是20万瓦。据统计，每天应对全球无数搜索请求，拥有很多超级计算机的Google公司每年用电可以达到23亿千瓦时（度），相当于20.7万户美国家庭一年的用电量，相当于41座帝国大厦一年用电量，一个表面上看起来并非传统重工业的公司却是个耗电大户。这使得很多研究人员尝试着模仿人的大脑制造出节能高效的电脑硬件。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n我们都知道，任何一台电脑里都需要有CPU，内存和硬盘，假设CPU是你，内存是桌子，硬盘是柜子，而程序则是那些你放在柜子里的各种书籍，文件，玩具等等，CPU负责运算和执行各个程序，硬盘储存着各个程序，如果你想看看书或者玩玩具，那得先把相应的东西从柜子里拿出来放到桌面上，然后你才可以在桌面上玩玩具或者写作业。桌子就相当于内存，是一个临时储存程序的地方。在电脑里，这三个部件缺一不可，可是在人的大脑里，我们并没有相应的这些部分，处理储存信息都是在一起同时进行的。按照传统计算机的结构，你玩完玩具想去看书，需要先把玩具从桌子放回柜子里，然后再从柜子里拿一本书拿到桌子上，完成很多个不同的任务需要一道道的工序，效率就会降低，可是大脑的结构允许你同时做很多件事情，不需要做完一件再做另外一件。\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n如今很多研究人员在尝试着模仿人类大脑制造出新型的计算机：它们平行地而不是一件一件地完成任务，它们更加模拟化而不是数字化，它们虽然会慢一些但是消耗的能源也很少。"}, "commit"=>"Update Review", "department_id"=>"1", "id"=>"7"}

在百科全书上，人工智能的定义是“有关可以智能地工作的机器的科学和工程”。不过一个令人纠结的问题是：到底什么是智能？即便那些“不智能”的机器在很多时候已经比我们聪明了，比如普通的计算机程序可以将成千上万个数字相乘，可以记录下银行大量余额款项，这已经超出了普通人的能力，可是他们只是能够大量重复做同一件事情，而且给出了正确的结果而已，还称不上真正的“智能”。只有某些人类特有的能力，像认出一张熟悉的脸，指挥繁忙时段的交通或者学会一件乐器，才有资格称得上“智能”。

 

为什么让一台机器做这些事情这么难？这是因为，一般程序员在给电脑编写程序之前知道他想让电脑做的任务是什么，可是在人工智能领域我们要求电脑做正确的事情，可同时又不是很清楚事情到底是什么。比如我们让电脑去识别人脸，可是我们人类自己也不是完全清楚大脑在识别人脸的时候到底是怎么样工作的。

 

在现实世界中，我们要面对种种不确定性，比如你在做一件事情的时候，一个竞争对手突然出现，阻止你达到目标；你在驾车的时候，有时会转动方向盘改变车的方向，避免撞上其他的车，但是这样做是不是一定安全，只有天知道；或者在正在完成一项任务的过程中，突然来了一条新消息，需要随机应变。一个人工智能的电脑程序不能仅仅按照既定的计划完成任务，需要处理类似上面这样的所有不确定性的情形。

 

为了模拟人类的智能，电脑程序不仅要模拟完成的任务本身，还要为这个任务所处的世界建立模型。他必须感知到周围环境的变化，并且做出反应，相应的改变和调整自己的行动。只有一台机器可以在不确定的条件下做出正确的决定，才称得上智能。

 

哲学起源

人工智能的概念在世界上第一台电脑出现之前的很多个世纪就已经初具端倪，亚里士多德提出的从假设得出结论的“三段论”就是一种机械式的逻辑推理方法，。按照他的理论，我们可以这样进行论述：

前提：一些天鹅是白的；所有天鹅都是鸟

结论：有一些鸟是白的。

如果用符号来表示：

前提：一些S是W，所有的S都是B

结论：有一些B是W。

无论S，W，B代表什么，也就是说无论这句话中的词语具体是什么，我们都可以得到正确的结论。根据这样的构想，我们在没有完全知道人是怎么想问题的情况下，或许就可以建立出一套智能化的工作机制。

 

亚里斯多德的构想为探寻人工智能的本质奠定了基础。然而直到二十世纪中期，电脑才变得足够复杂，能够去真正测试一下这些构想。1948年英国布里斯托尔大学的研究人员Grey Walter制造了一些可以移动，可以感光，可以学习的机器乌龟。其中有一个叫Elsie的机器乌龟可以自动地对环境做出反应，比如当电池电量快耗尽的时候它就会自动地降低对光线的敏感度。这些复杂的行为使得这只机械乌龟看起来不仅仅是个机器人，而是像自然界的动物一样，会做出我们预料不到的举动。

 

在1950年，天才图灵提出，如果电脑和一个人可以谈话自如，我们应该“礼貌地”接受电脑可以思考的现实。

 

不过直到1956年，人工智能这个词语才正式被提出。在美国达特茅斯学院的一个暑期工作坊上，这个领域的早期创始者们共同提出了他们的愿景：如果学习的各种方式和智能各个侧面都可以从理论上进行精确描述，这样一台机器就可以模拟人的一切。按照这样的目标快速发展，似乎拥有真人一般智能的机器早晚会出现。

 

**化整为零**

 

在二十世纪六十年代的时候，人工智能研究人员满怀梦想，信心十足，觉着他们将会在几十年的时间内实现他们的目标，就像在航天领域从第一架喷气式飞机到人类登上月球也只用了30年。为什么人工智能不可以拥有这样火箭般的发展速度呢？

 

不过两者之间最大的不同之处在于，对于人工智能，我们找不到像F=ma和E=mc^2那样既简洁又决定一切的公式。到了八十年代，研究者意识到他们既没有足够硬件也没有足够的知识来模拟人可以做的所有事情，于是整个领域分成了很多个部分。以往研究者的共同的目标是制造一台拥有人类智慧的电脑，取而代之的是，研究者侧重于去研究这个宏大问题的某个侧面，比如语音识别，计算机视觉，概率推理-甚至仅仅是国际象棋这个小领域。

 

在每个领域内，研究者都取得了可喜的进步。在1997年，IBM“更深的蓝”电脑击败了国际象棋冠军卡斯帕罗夫。“更深的蓝”电脑在决定下一步怎么走棋的时候，在一秒的时间内就可以计算出两亿种不同的可能性。这使得电脑棋手可以在下一步棋之前事先推算出之后很多很多步棋可能出现的各种情况，来决定哪种局面是对自己最有利的。

 

“更深的蓝”电脑可以在一项需要高度智能的游戏中取得引人瞩目的胜利，然而，这位“专家”的技能有点太单一了，除了赢得一场象棋比赛以外，它什么都不会做，既不能和别人讨论他在下棋的时候使用过的策略，也不能玩其他的游戏，它尽管赢了世界大师，但是没有人会把它错当作真人，它还仅仅是一台电脑。

日常生活中的AI

你或许没有意识到，其实你每天都在和AI人工智能打交道，它们在帮你选择手机通话线路，在审核你的信用卡交易，在过滤掉诈骗垃圾e-mail和自动管理你的基金进行股票交易。它们还可以在你的数码照片中识别出你的脸，或者你在玩视频游戏的时候识别你的手势，甚至可以帮助你的医生分析化验结果，这些常见的电脑程序其实都拥有真人一样的智能。

 

数据挖掘者

2011年，IBM公司向世界推出了Watson，一个可以理解用日常语言提出的问题，并且可以准确地给出答案的超级计算机。Watson拥有3000个联网在一起的处理器，每个处理器可以看作是一台小型的电脑，它们一共储存着几百万份文件，Watson可以随时抽出其中的一份来帮助回答任何问题。

 

IBM选择了在美国一个电视问答娱乐节目Jeopardy上让Watson这个计算巨人首次登场亮相，Jeopardy节目一向以提出“拐弯抹角”的问题而出名，有点像国内的开心辞典和幸运52。这个游戏可比国际象棋复杂的多，Watson不仅需要综合所有人类知识，还需要理解节目问题中的各种文字游戏。

 

在Watson在节目舞台上精彩表现的背后，人工智能的一个分支概率推理功不可没：这种推理可以在不完整的信息组合中提取出一幅完成的画面。在比赛开始前，大量的维基百科文字，网页和其他参考资料，以及以往Jeopardy节目的资料都被塞进了Watson的硬盘里。然后IBM的工程师们把Watson的电脑程序分成了100个小程序，每个小程序负责一个方面，比如一个程序会专门负责“著名作家”，另一个程序负责“食品”。当这些“各个领域的专家”搜索完了各自的数据库之后，Watson会综合这100个分程序的结果，选择出最有可能正确的答案。Watson曾经在电视节目中击败两位真人的冠军。

 

不过成为Jeopardy比赛的冠军并不是Watson的真正使命，IBM计划利用Watson完成一些更加严肃的任务，比如给医学、商业、农业这些领域提供时效性很强的关键信息。

 

行驶在公路上的AI

在通往拉斯维加斯的公路上，如果你看到一辆汽车上面有红色的车牌和无穷大符号，就要留意一下了，这可能是一辆无人驾驶的汽车。内华达州为无人驾驶汽车发放了第一张牌照。

 

在世界上其他地方，无人驾驶汽车也会火起来吗？应该说，到现在为止，驾驶还是一项仍旧由真人司机占据主导地位的任务，因为驾车虽然称不上很难，但其中有太多变量，比如正在接近你的车是以60公里每小时还是70公里每小时行驶？在角落里会不会还有一辆在你的视角之外的车？如果我想超过前面的车，前面车的司机会不会突然超速？诸如此类的问题还会有很多。

 

对于人工智能来说，在公路上无人驾驶汽车还不算是最难的任务，早在1994年，两辆无人驾驶汽车就曾经在环绕巴黎的公路上行驶了1000公里。但是如果让无人驾驶汽车在城市中穿行，任务一下子就变得困难很多，城市交通中很多不成文的规则会让AI汽车摸不到头脑。比如说，如果Google的研究者严格按照司机守则为AI汽车编写程序，在十字路口上一定要为其他汽车让路，他们会发现这台太过老实的无人驾驶汽车永远也没法走过这个路口。于是，他们对程序做了一点改进，当AI汽车等待了一段时间之后，就会自动缓慢向前移动，向其他汽车示意自己想要先走，而不只是傻傻地等待。

 

对于自动驾驶汽车还有一个不确定性是如何判断自己所处的位置，GPS卫星定位数据有时并不靠谱，误差会达到几米之多，AI汽车在使用GPS的同时，还会同时开启照相机、雷达和激光定位功能，共同帮助校正GPS的数据，不要让汽车越走越偏。这几项定位功能每一项都有自己的优缺点，都不是完全准确的，但是综合到一起就可以达到很高的精确度。

 

除了直接驾驶汽车以外，AI还可以自动调节汽车燃料进出，节约能源。作为前沿科技的自动驾驶汽车综合了人工智能很多方面的技术，越来越被人们所接受。通过特别许可，Google的自动驾驶汽车已经在完全无人控制的情况下，在加州的公路和街区中穿行了成千上万公里。美国佛罗里达州和加州已经通过立法允许自动驾驶汽车这种新型交通工具的使用，其他许多州也在积极讨论这一事宜。

垃圾邮件杀手

在如今的全世界的电子邮件中，每十封恐怕有九封都是垃圾邮件，如果这些垃圾邮件和正常邮件混在一起出现在你的收件夹里，恐怕没人再会用email了。能够把垃圾邮件从正常邮件中过滤出来的人工智能领域称为机器学习。正如名字里所说，垃圾邮件过滤器可以从环境中和从邮箱的主人怎样对待邮件中学习什么是好邮件和坏邮件。

 

要判断什么样的邮件才算是垃圾邮件，只要看一下每天email的使用者打开邮箱之后，把哪些邮件加上星号保留，把哪些邮件看也不看就直接删掉，这些举动为垃圾邮件过滤器提供了最好的参考。电脑程序会根据这些信息把每个邮件分解成很多个“特征”，一个特征可以是单个词，也可以是一个词组，邮件发送的时间，或者邮件是由哪一台电脑发送过来的。这些特征可以帮助电脑程序决定一封邮件是正常邮件还是垃圾邮件。比如说，一封邮件里包括了“最低价格”、“精心包装”这两个特征词组，而根据全球统计，这两个词组在垃圾邮件中出现的比率高达8%和3%，而在正常邮件中，它们出现的比例只有0.1%和0.3%。之后在假设这些词语出现的几率是独立的前提下，通过数学上的贝叶斯定律公式和上面两项特征的统计数据，计算出这封邮件是垃圾邮件的概率有99.9%之高。

 

垃圾邮件过滤器最重要的事情就是根据经验不断更新它使用的邮件判定模型。再好的垃圾邮件过滤器也会有犯错误的时候，可能放过坏邮件，也可能错杀好邮件，每当邮箱的主人把一封垃圾邮件箱里的邮件移回收件夹里或者在收件夹里点一下删除的时候，垃圾邮件过滤器会立刻更正自己的参数，做出新的改进，以提高识别邮件的准确率。对于编写垃圾邮件过滤器的程序员来说，他们并不需要一步一步地制定出繁琐的邮件判别标准，只需要构建一个人工智能系统，然后通过例子和真正的email来训练这套系统，让垃圾邮件过滤AI程序自己提高自己。

 

万能翻译

在任何一天，Google翻译功能所翻译的文字量比全世界所有专业翻译人员每年翻译量的总合还要大。Google翻译可以在65种语言之间任意两种之间进行翻译，一共有超过4000种翻译方式。Google翻译能够运行，一定离不开人工智能的一个领域——概率推理。

 

在很多年前，语言学家通过双语字典上大量的词汇和一条条的语法规则来构建自动的翻译系统。但是这样做却失败了，如此的翻译会很生硬、很不灵活。比如法语语法规则里一般形容词在名词后面，英语语法规则里一般形容词在名词前面，可是也有例外的时候，比如“the light fantastic”。

 

在过去二三十年里，自动翻译依靠的不再是语言学家制定的规则，而是从现实的例子中自动学习而来的由概率支配的规则，就好像以往是通过背单词和记语法来学外语，而现在是通过身临语言环境中学习。

 

自动翻译另外一个重要方面是电脑和真人之间的配合和交互，很多自动翻译系统都是先在互联网上搜集大量真人翻译过的文件作为基础。

 

当然自动翻译还远远称不上完美，但是它正在逐渐改进，准确度越来越高，语言的种类也越来越多。Google正在研究一个名为Translate的Android手机小程序，每当你对手机说一句话时，这个小程序可以把你所说的话转换成任意一种语言，发送给和你通电话的人，而对方在手机上也可以说自己的语言。随着自动翻译技术的发展，一个被长久期盼的诱人目标将有机会实现——每个人不需要学习任何外语，就可以和世界各地的朋友进行交流。

 

人工智能的新未来

在过去半个世纪中，几个关键的发展推动着人工智能科技出现在我们的身边。如今，科学家们对于神经科学和认知科学的新认识可以让我们设计出更新的硬件和软件。互联网的发展也使得直接访问全球的海量数据变得可能。不仅如此，人工智能或许还可以自己依靠自己来进化。

 

进化

现今大多数的人工智能系统如果完全依靠手动来编写程序，会变得很复杂，一个另辟蹊径的方法是让电脑程序自己进化自己。在虚拟的环境中，程序通过不断的迭代，尝试变化各种参数，在不断尝试和失败之中，程序逐渐“自然而然”变成设计者期望的样子。

 

首先设计者们对于程序所在的环境进行模拟，就像一个游泳池或者一片沙漠一样，比如对于垃圾邮件过滤器，“环境”就是大量的邮件，既包括正常邮件也包括垃圾邮件。然后一个人工智能AI程序的不同版本会同时在模拟的环境中进行测试，这些AI程序会给出各自不同的输出结果，输出结果的质量会被评分，分数比较好的AI程序会被进一步的修改，分数比较差的AI程序会被遗弃掉，修改后的程序有的可以进一步变得更好，有的则会不如以前，同样优胜劣汰，如此往复，最后原本几个普通程序可以自然进化成很好的人工智能系统。

 

这个过程其实非常像自然界中所发生的“弱肉强食，适者生存”，而一个程序的某个参数被修改如同基因突变，两个程序还可以各取一部分交叉到一起产生一个新的程序，就如同动物交配产生后代一样，这种让电脑程序自己进化自己的方法被称为“遗传算法”。

 

电脑也需要直觉

人类永远不是绝对理性的，我们在做决定的时候会犯很多常见的错误，会很容易受无关细节的干扰。有的时候我们并没有经过事实判断，匆匆忙忙做出一个决定，也就是常说的“相信自己的直觉”。我们曾经觉着“冷静”的电脑不像人一样冲动，一定是件好事，可是最近的认知科学研究结果却发现事实并非如此。

 

一个人先天具有两种相互配套的做决定的方式，一种是缓慢的、深思熟虑的但同时也是理性的，另一种是快速的，有爆发力的，可以把当前的情况迅速和以往的经验联系起来，一两秒钟中做出决定。第二种方式或许才是人类智能的关键。

 

我们在进行深思熟虑的时候，理性必定要以耗费更多的时间和精力为代价。比如有一辆车正迎面撞向你驾驶的车，你需要立刻做出反应，或者鸣笛，或者刹车，或者转向，而不是经过复杂的计算决定哪种选择是最优的，估计等结果算出来事故已经发生了。这种快速反应在非紧急情况下也同样有使用的必要，比如你如果每天都在仔细思考到底穿深蓝色衣服还是浅蓝色衣服这样无关紧要的问题，会浪费大量的时间和精力，耽误重要的事情。

 

那么人工智能中是不是也应该加入直觉的成分呢？事实上，很多现代的人工智能系统真的有两部分，一部分用于瞬时反应的情况，另外一部分用于需要更多理性分析的情况。一些机器人使用多层系统结构，最底层只做直接的反应，较高的层组织和抑制这些反应，去完成更复杂的目标。这种方式可以很有效，控制步行机器人在凹凸不平的地面上行走就是一个例子。

 

另外一种类似的方式是在人工智能程序中加入一些“情感”，比如一个机器人如果反复尝试做一件事情，不断失败，一个表达“气馁”情感的电路就可以“激励”机器人寻找新的选择。

 

让机器来模拟情感本身就是件很复杂的任务，人工智能的创始者之一Marvin Minsky曾经认为情感并不是人的大脑所做的一件事，而是包括了大脑的很多部分之间的相互作用，还有大脑和身体之间的相互作用。情感会驱使我们做出某些选择，如果电脑程序的某部分能够让程序变得好像被情感驱使了一样，电脑程序自然变得更像人类的智能。

 

像大脑一样的机器

既然我们的目标是制造一台具有人类智能的机器，为何不直接复制一下人的大脑呢？人类自己毕竟是智能的最好样本。在过去的二三十年，神经科学对于我们的大脑是怎样处理和储存信息产生了很多新的认识。

 

人类的大脑是由100万亿个神经突触连接着1000亿个神经元组成的一个网络，这些神经突触和神经元会在每秒内改变10到100次状态。我们大脑的这种结构使得它非常善于完成在一张图片中识别出一个物体这样的任务。

 

而一台超级计算机可以拥有100万亿字节的内存，拥有的晶体管电路的运算速度比人的大脑快1亿倍，这种结构使得计算机擅长于去快速完成明确定义、工作量大、要求精确的任务。

 

这两种结构各有优缺点，不过完成很多模糊性任务的时候，人脑的结构更加占据优势，比如像识别人脸，我们并不需要进行精确计算的电路。

 

相比于超级计算机，人的大脑也是一台很节能的机器，人的大脑进行各种计算的时候，大约只需要20瓦的功率，只相当于一个亮度很低的老式电灯泡。而一台进行类似计算的超级计算机所需要的能量将会是20万瓦。据统计，每天应对全球无数搜索请求，拥有很多超级计算机的Google公司每年用电可以达到23亿千瓦时（度），相当于20.7万户美国家庭一年的用电量，相当于41座帝国大厦一年用电量，一个表面上看起来并非传统重工业的公司却是个耗电大户。这使得很多研究人员尝试着模仿人的大脑制造出节能高效的电脑硬件。

 

我们都知道，任何一台电脑里都需要有CPU，内存和硬盘，假设CPU是你，内存是桌子，硬盘是柜子，而程序则是那些你放在柜子里的各种书籍，文件，玩具等等，CPU负责运算和执行各个程序，硬盘储存着各个程序，如果你想看看书或者玩玩具，那得先把相应的东西从柜子里拿出来放到桌面上，然后你才可以在桌面上玩玩具或者写作业。桌子就相当于内存，是一个临时储存程序的地方。在电脑里，这三个部件缺一不可，可是在人的大脑里，我们并没有相应的这些部分，处理储存信息都是在一起同时进行的。按照传统计算机的结构，你玩完玩具想去看书，需要先把玩具从桌子放回柜子里，然后再从柜子里拿一本书拿到桌子上，完成很多个不同的任务需要一道道的工序，效率就会降低，可是大脑的结构允许你同时做很多件事情，不需要做完一件再做另外一件。

 

如今很多研究人员在尝试着模仿人类大脑制造出新型的计算机：它们平行地而不是一件一件地完成任务，它们更加模拟化而不是数字化，它们虽然会慢一些但是消耗的能源也很少。', "updated_at" = '2013-06-28 16:12:20.064584' WHERE "reviews"."id" = 7
