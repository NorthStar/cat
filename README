Wanmen's CMS System
---------------------

The system is based on Rails, a robust Ruby framework. 
Please get familiar with the Rails getting-started document before stepping into the CMS system 
(http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html).

Wanmen.org consists of several departments where each department has its own booklists (万门书单), 
reviews (万门经验贴) and videos (万门视频).

Reviews
--------
The reviews are standard formatted markdown documents. 
To render the Markdown format in the browser, we utilized a ruby markdown parser named Kramdown 
(http://kramdown.rubyforge.org). Kramdown needs to be installed in the server to make the system work.
