Project Schrodinger's Cat
==========================
Wanmen's CMS System
---------------------

The system is based on Rails, a robustic Ruby framework. 
Please get familiar with the Rails getting-started document before stepping into the CMS system http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html

Wanmen.org consists of several departments where each department has its own booklists（万门书单）,reviews（万门经验贴）and videos（万门视频).


How to boot
-----------
Assuming gem and rake, simply open Terminal, get to our 
Schrodingers-Cat directory and type
    gem install kramdown
    bundle install
followed by
    rake routes
Wait for a couple of minutes and then type
    rails server
Now open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the site.


Reviews
--------
The reviews are standard formatted markdown documents. To render the Markdown format in the browser, we utilized a ruby markdown parser named Kramdown http://kramdown.rubyforge.org. Kramdown needs to be installed in the server to make the system work
